"""ar.gate.run — the Tier-3 PR-gate execution path (spec §4/§8.1/§12).

run_pr_gate ties the no-GPU dispatch core together: read the PR's changed files,
classify the risk, run every arch's gate, and reduce to a PR outcome + comment.
The per-arch gate is an injected seam:

  * --dry-run  -> ``stub_arch_gate`` (no GPU, no daemon build): exercises the whole
                  classify -> route -> decide -> comment pipeline on a REAL diff.
  * real (on a self-hosted runner) -> ``live_arch_gate`` builds base/head daemons
                  and runs the Phase-1 ``run_gate`` + Phase-2 ``gate4`` over the
                  ``LiveServeRunner`` GPU adapter.

Only ``live_arch_gate`` touches the GPU/ROCm/cargo; everything else is pure and
unit-testable with an injected ``run_git`` + ``arch_gate_fn``.
