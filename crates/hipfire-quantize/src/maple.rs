//! Maple-Preview onboarding: native-ternary detection and exact packing.
//!
//! `deepgrove/maple-preview` publishes DEQUANTIZED bf16 masters (40.4 GB) whose
//! values are already ternary: every linear row is `{-s_r, 0, +s_r}` with one
//! bf16 scale per OUTPUT ROW. Nothing in the published `modeling_maple.py`
//! quantizes anything — the `quantize: true` config key is dead. The structure
//! lives in the values.
//!
//! So this is a packing problem, not a quantization problem, and the bar is
//! exactness. We verify ternary-ness per ROW (a per-tensor summary would
//! happily average over a bad row) and refuse anything else, because a silent
//! lossy fallback would be indistinguishable from success right up until the
//! model generated garbage.
