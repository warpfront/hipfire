//! Targets are types. A kernel names its target once (`Workgroup<Gfx1151, _>`)
//! and every capability it uses is a trait bound that only targets with a
//! certified lowering implement, so a missing capability is a rustc error
//! rather than a run-time `Err` from the builder.
//!
//! M0 covers the three bench architectures (RDNA3 gfx1100, RDNA3.5 gfx1151,
//! RDNA4 gfx1201). gfx942 and its FNUZ fp8 type are a documented future
//! extension (design §4.1, §4.4), not part of this core.
