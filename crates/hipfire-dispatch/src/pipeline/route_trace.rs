//! Opt-in capture of the routed-expert SELECTION, so "prefill and decode
//! sometimes choose different experts" can be a measured rate instead of an
//! estimate.
//!
//! # Why the selection and not the router logits
//!
//! It is tempting to capture the logits and re-run top-k on the host. That
//! measures a different thing: the device kernels
//! (`moe_router_softmax_topk_k8_*` / `moe_topk_renorm_k8_batched`) have their
//! own ordering and tie-breaking, and a host re-implementation would attribute
//! its own disagreements with them to the routes. What matters is what the
//! model actually computed with, so this records the `topk_indices` buffer the
//! expert GEMVs are about to index with.
//!
//! # Why it is a file and not a return value
//!
//! The two routes being compared are a batched prefill and a per-token loop;
//! they are called from different places, produce a different number of
//! records per call, and neither has a natural channel back to the caller that
//! wants the comparison. A trace file keyed by call order is the cheapest
//! thing that lets one gate read both.
//!
//! Off unless `HIPFIRE_ESCHA_ROUTE_TRACE` names a path. When off, the only
//! cost is one relaxed atomic load per MoE layer.
//!
//! # Record format
//!
//! Little-endian, appended in CALL ORDER:
//!
//! ```text
//! u32 n_tokens        // rows in this record (1 for decode, chunk size for prefill)
//! u32 k               // experts per token
//! i32 ids[n_tokens*k] // token-major: row t is ids[t*k .. (t+1)*k]
//! ```
//!
//! A reader reconstructs `(token, layer)` from call order: every MoE layer
//! emits exactly one record per forward, so with `L` MoE layers the j-th
//! record of a per-token run is `(token = j / L, layer = j % L)` and the j-th
//! record of a batched run covering one chunk is `(layer = j % L)` with its
//! `n_tokens` rows being that chunk's tokens in order. Readers MUST check the
//! totals agree rather than assuming — see the gate.
