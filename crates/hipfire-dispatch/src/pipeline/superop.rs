//! Forward-as-pipeline (#397 Ship 6) — the **C-design lowered super-op
//! substrate**.
//!
//! A model's per-layer forward is lowered ONCE at model load into a
//! [`LoweredForward`] (a `Vec<LayerProgram>`); each [`LayerProgram`] is a short
//! list of COARSE [`SuperOp`]s that map 1:1 onto the existing fused kernels.
//! Per-token execution is then a tight loop over pre-resolved super-ops — no
//! `resolve()`, no `FUSED_TABLE`/`match_prefix` walk, no per-call `WeightRef`
//! construction. The fusion decision (which `FUSED_TABLE` entry fires) and the
//! kernel `KernelKey` are resolved at LOWER time and frozen in [`OpBinding`].
//!
//! ## Why super-ops are POD (no lifetimes / no raw-ptr capture)
//! Design B (a `Box<dyn Fn(&mut Gpu, &Frame)>` per op) was rejected: collapsing
//! the today-disjoint `&mut Gpu / &mut KvCache / &mut DeltaNetState / &Scratch`
//! args into one `Frame` forces `RefCell` (hot-path borrow checks = perf loss)
//! or `UnsafeCell` (the a9e8dfda aliasing-bug class, minus the compiler). So a
//! `SuperOp` carries only **indices** ([`WeightSlot`]/[`ScratchSlot`]) + a
//! resolved [`KernelKey`] + flavor data — pure POD. The per-token executor
//! (built in a later step) re-borrows the live `GpuTensor`s from the model's
//! weight/scratch/state tables BY INDEX and calls the resolved family method,
//! so the compiler still proves disjointness at each call site.
//!
//! ## Coverage (the whole served fleet, one substrate)
//! - `Proj` / `ResidualGemv` / `Moe`     → qwen35, MiniMax(reuse), cohere2moe(reuse)
//! - `Attend` (flavor-carrying)          → all; Gemma SWA/qk-norm/softcap/k_eq_v live here as flavors
//! - `Recurrent`                         → qwen35 DeltaNet linear-attention state
//! - `Conv`                              → LFM2 depthwise causal short-conv mixer (+ conv state)
//! - `Escape(EscapeKind)`                → irregular/stateful: deepseek4 compressor/indexer/SWA, etc.
//!
//! NOTE: nothing here is on a live path yet. The live forward remains
//! `execute_steps`; this substrate is wired behind `HIPFIRE_FORWARD_LOWERED`
//! (default off) in later steps, validated byte-identical via the
//! `HIPFIRE_FORWARD_ORACLE` dual-run.
