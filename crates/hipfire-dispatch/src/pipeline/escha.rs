//! Escha-W2 routed-expert decode executors (Tasks 10 and 11).
//!
//! Two entry points, one for each of the two routes into a routed MoE layer.
//! Both apply the SAME phase structure and the SAME H128 pair; they differ
//! only in where the routing lives.
//!
//! * [`escha_routed_decode`] — CPU-top-K route. `topk_ids` / `topk_weights`
//!   arrive on the HOST, already downloaded by
//!   [`super::run_moe_decode_cpu_fallback`]. Used when the layer is not
//!   admitted to the indexed path (k != 8, F32 control experts in the G4
//!   gate, …).
//! * [`escha_routed_decode_indexed`] — GPU-top-K route, the production
//!   decode/prefill path. Routing stays on the device end to end: the ids
//!   feed the transforms and the GEMVs as a device buffer, the combine
//!   weights are f16-rounded by a device kernel, and there is no D2H
//!   anywhere in the layer.
//!
//! Everything around them — the router GEMV, the f16 logit rounding, top-k
//! selection, and the shared expert — is unchanged arch-6 code.
//!
//! # Why the indexed route exists (Task 11, measured)
//!
//! `rocprofv3 --kernel-trace` over a warm 40-layer decode token on gfx1151:
//! 22.0 ms of GPU-busy against a 29.7 ms wall (profiled; 26.0 ms unprofiled),
//! of which the routed experts were 6.5 ms of kernel time, ~2.1 ms of
//! launch-gap across their 640 per-expert GEMV launches, and ~2.1 ms of
//! copy/stall around the per-layer `topk_indices` + `topk_weights` D2H and the
//! ids/weights H2D that followed it. The host round trip alone did NOT
//! dominate — but the round trip and the launch storm together were the whole
//! addressable overhead, and the round trip is also what made the layer
//! non-capturable under hipGraph. This route removes both: 640 routed GEMV
//! launches per token become 80, and the per-layer sync disappears.
//!
//! # Why the routed loop needs replacing at all
//!
//! Escha's weights live in a ROTATED domain: the stored matrix is
//! `H·W·H` (up to the folded per-channel scales), so a matmul against it is
//! only the intended linear if the activation is Hadamard-transformed going
//! in and the result is Hadamard-transformed coming out. `escha_h128_in`
//! before the GEMV and `escha_h128_out` after are not a normalisation detail;
//! omitting them yields plausible-looking output that is wrong by ~1e-1
//! rather than ~1e-4.
//!
//! # Why it is phase-structured rather than a per-expert loop
//!
//! Task 8 measured the H128 kernels LAUNCH-bound: an empty kernel at the same
//! grid/block costs 1.74–1.78 us against a real launch's 2.4 us, and
//! overhead-subtracted time is nearly flat (0.59 → 0.69 us) from 16 to 136
//! blocks. A per-expert wiring costs `40 layers × 8 experts × 4 transforms =
//! 1280` launches/token = 3.07 ms = a **326 tok/s ceiling from the transforms
//! alone**, before any GEMV work. Running the token's `k` experts in phases —
//! all inputs transformed, then all GEMVs, then all outputs transformed — is
//! **4 H128-family launches per layer, 160 per token, 0.38 ms**.
//!
//! Phase order (per layer, decode, one token). The `host` column is
//! [`escha_routed_decode`], `idx` is [`escha_routed_decode_indexed`]:
//!
//! | # | host | idx | what |
//! |---|------|-----|------|
//! | 0 | 0 (host-side rounding) | 1 | `escha_round_weights_f16_rne` |
//! | 1 | 1 | 1 | `escha_h128_in_batched` — gate_up input side, x broadcast |
//! | 2 | k | 1 | Q8_0 gate_up GEMV (per expert / all experts indexed) |
//! | 3 | 1 | 1 | `escha_h128_out_batched` — gate_up output side |
//! | 4 | 1 | 1 | `escha_swiglu_batched` |
//! | 5 | 1 | 1 | `escha_h128_in_batched` — down input side, per-slot x |
//! | 6 | k | 1 | Q8_0 down GEMV (per expert / all experts indexed) |
//! | 7 | 1 | 1 | `escha_h128_out_batched` — down output side |
//! | 8 | 1 | 1 | `moe_down_combine_k8_batched` with f16-rounded scores |
//!
//! At k=8 that is 22 launches + 2 H2D + (2 D2H upstream) per layer on the
//! host route against 9 launches and no host transfer at all on the indexed
//! one. The H128 budget — 4 per layer — is identical on both, which is why
//! `escha_launches_per_token` and the gates that read it are route-agnostic.
//!
//! The per-expert `rin_eff` / `rout_eff` rows are an extra index into the
//! already-resident `[E, IC]` / `[E, OC]` tensors — the batching is a kernel
//! indexing change plus a grid change, not new maths, and it is gated
//! bit-exactly against `escha_ref` by
//! `rdna-compute/examples/test_escha_h128_gpu_vs_cpu.rs`.
