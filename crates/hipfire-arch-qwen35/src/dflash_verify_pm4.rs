//! Retained-PM4 route state for the fixed **B=16** DFlash2 target-verify
//! forward.
//!
//! This module owns the *pure* half of the route: phase, admission binding,
//! counters, and the state machine that decides which forward route a verify
//! window takes. It performs no GPU work of its own — the caller in
//! [`crate::speculative`] owns capture, preparation, replay, and every HIP
//! fallback, and reports each outcome back here.
//!
//! Scope is deliberately narrow (see the design record): the tape covers only
//! the fixed B=16 chain target forward. Token/position upload, the recurrent
//! snapshot, hidden staging commit, lm-head, argmax, acceptance, snapshot
//! restore, and committed-prefix GDN replay all stay outside it.
//!
//! ## Why the controller is optional
//!
//! [`DflashVerifyPm4Phase::Disabled`] must structurally guarantee that no
//! retained controller holds a model pointer. Storing the controller as an
//! `Option` makes that an ownership fact rather than a convention, and lets
//! [`DflashVerifyPm4::shutdown`] release it before any captured allocation is
//! freed.
