//! Pure (no-GPU) adaptive verify-block controller for DFlash chain spec-decode.
//!
//! Long-context sessions stop paying a fixed B=16 full-KV verify scan per
//! cycle: the controller tracks the trailing [`ADAPTIVE_WINDOW`] verify cycles'
//! accepted-draft counts and shrinks the per-cycle proposal width to just past
//! the observed acceptance depth:
//!
//! ```text
//! τ̂ = Σ accepted / cycles              (trailing 8 verify cycles)
//! effective = clamp(ceil(τ̂) + 2, 2, full)
//! ```
//!
//! The `+2` headroom covers the +1 bonus token plus one row of accept-run
//! jitter, so a meeting-expectations window never starves the verify. The
//! controller seeds at full and holds full until [`ADAPTIVE_WINDOW`] cycles
//! are observed (no shrink on bootstrap noise), and returns full
//! unconditionally when the knob is off — fixed-B behaviour is then identical
//! to before.
//!
//! This generalizes the `dflash_spec_demo --adaptive-b` outer τ-window
//! trip-wire (τ < 2.5 → shrink block to 8) from a single threshold into a
//! continuous depth-following width.
//!
//! Greedy-parity (why shrinking never changes emitted tokens): the draft is
//! causal, so the first k rows of a width-B proposal are identical to a
//! width-k proposal; verify accepts the longest greedy prefix, and the bonus
//! token is the target argmax at the divergence point — the same token the
//! full-width run would have accepted there. Fewer proposed rows can only
//! shorten the accepted run, never change its tokens; only window boundaries
//! move.
//!
//! Env-free by construction: the `HIPFIRE_DFLASH_ADAPTIVE_B=0` kill-switch is
//! resolved by `build_dflash_speculator` (mirroring DSpark's
//! `HIPFIRE_DSPARK_ADAPTIVE_BLOCK=0` in `build_dspark_speculator`), so this
//! controller is unit-testable without a device — see the tests below.
