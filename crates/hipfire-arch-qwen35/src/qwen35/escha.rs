//! Escha-W2 routed-expert loading for arch-6 (Task 10).
//!
//! An Escha-W2 `.hfq` stores each MoE projection as ONE tensor per layer
//! covering all `num_experts` experts:
//!
//! | tensor | qt | shape | meaning |
//! |---|---|---|---|
//! | `…experts.gate_up_proj.escha_code` | 42 (`ESCHA2T16`) | `[E, ic/16, oc/16, 16*2]` i16 | K=2 trellis code |
//! | `…experts.gate_up_proj.escha_rin_eff` | 2 (F32) | `[E, ic]` | folded input scales |
//! | `…experts.gate_up_proj.escha_rout_eff` | 2 (F32) | `[E, oc]` | folded output scales (carries the prune mask) |
//! | `…experts.down_proj.escha_code` | 43 (`ESCHA3T16`) | `[E, ic/16, oc/16, 16*3]` i16 | K=3 trellis code |
//! | `…experts.down_proj.escha_rin_eff` / `…rout_eff` | 2 (F32) | `[E, ic]` / `[E, oc]` | |
//!
//! ## Orientation — the one thing that must not be got wrong
//!
//! Escha's code tile grid is **IN-MAJOR** (`[in/16, out/16]`) and
//! `Gpu::escha_decode_tiles` writes bare fp16 **row-major `[in_features,
//! out_features]`**. hipfire's expert slots are **OUT-MAJOR** —
//! `experts[X].gate_up` is `[2*moe_intermediate, hidden]` (see
//! `weights.rs:69`) and every hipfire GEMV walks K contiguously along a row.
//! So on the three DECODING stores a transpose happens, and it happens exactly
//! once, folded into the store pass (`Gpu::escha_bare_to_q8_0` and friends). A
//! wrong orientation still yields a full-rank, plausible weight matrix, so it
//! is gated by the G4 block gate, never by "the output looks sane".
//!
//! [`EschaWeightStore::Native`] keeps escha's in-major grid instead, because
//! it stores the code and never materialises a matrix at all; the fused GEMV
//! addresses the in-major tile grid directly. Same hazard, same gate.
//!
//! hipfire's `gate_up` slot is already FUSED (gate ‖ up), matching escha's
//! single fused `gate_up_proj`, so there is no concat step.
//!
//! ## Why production stores the CODE (Phase 2)
//!
//! Phase 1 decoded to `Q8_0` at load: 1.0625 B/weight, 34.2 GB of routed
//! experts, 37.55 GB resident, and 1.07 GB of routed-expert traffic on every
//! decode token. That put a hard 69 tok/s roofline on a box measured at
//! 209 GB/s — under the 71.8 tok/s the comparable `qwen3.6:35b-a3b-mq4r` SKU
//! already reaches, so Q8_0 could not have won at any efficiency.
//!
//! [`EschaWeightStore::Native`] stores the trellis code verbatim (2.00 bpw for
//! the K=2 gate_up, 3.00 for the K=3 down) and decodes it inside the routed
//! GEMV. It is both smaller AND weight-exact — the `Q8_0` re-quantisation that
//! dominates the G4 block gate's error simply does not happen. The remaining
//! decoding stores are measurement arms: [`EschaWeightStore::Q8_0`] is Phase 1,
//! kept because every published Phase 1 number was measured on it,
//! [`EschaWeightStore::F16`] is the G5 KLD reference, and
//! [`EschaWeightStore::F32`] is a small-layer weight-exact control.
