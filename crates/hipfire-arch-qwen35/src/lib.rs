//! hipfire-arch-qwen35: Qwen3.5 architecture (dense + MoE / A3B / A10B / A17B).
//!
//! This crate implements the [`hipfire_runtime::arch::Architecture`] trait
//! for Qwen3.5. It owns the model forward pass, weight loading, KV-state
//! layout, and the speculative-decoding glue that today is qwen35-specific
//! (`speculative.rs`, `pflash.rs`).
//!
//! Future work (per docs/plans/engine-modularization.prd Phase 2):
//!   - `speculative.rs` and `pflash.rs` will become arch-generic and move
//!     back into `hipfire-runtime`. They live here today because the
//!     existing impls are deeply coupled to `qwen35::*` symbols (config,
//!     weights, scratch, forward functions). PR 8 freezes the dep direction
//!     `arch-qwen35 → runtime`, but accepts that today's spec/pflash are
//!     not generic enough to live above the arch boundary.
//!
//! The `arch` module exposes the trait impl for use by the runtime's
//! daemon and other consumers via `hipfire_arch_qwen35::Qwen35`.

// Qwen3.5 is a hybrid DeltaNet + FullAttention architecture; all the
// runtime infrastructure it touches is `deltanet`-gated. When the parent
// build doesn't enable the feature, the crate is a no-op stub. This keeps
// `cargo build --no-default-features` working and matches the gating that
// was on `engine::qwen35` pre-Phase-2.
