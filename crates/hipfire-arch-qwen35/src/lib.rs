//! hipfire-arch-qwen35: Qwen3.5 architecture (dense + MoE / A3B / A10B / A17B).
//!
//! This crate implements the [`hipfire_runtime::arch::Architecture`] trait
//! for Qwen3.5. It owns the model forward pass, weight loading, KV-state
//! layout, and the speculative-decoding glue that today is qwen35-specific
//! (`speculative.rs`; `pflash.rs` evacuated to `hipfire-pflash` per lean-up
//! map B3 — retained legacy research, not mainline).
//!
//! Future work (per docs/plans/engine-modularization.prd Phase 2):
//!   - `speculative.rs` will become arch-generic and move back into
//!     `hipfire-runtime`. It lives here today because the existing impl is
//!     deeply coupled to `qwen35::*` symbols (config, weights, scratch,
//!     forward functions). `pflash.rs` was evacuated to `hipfire-pflash`
//!     per lean-up map B3 (§5.1) — retained legacy research, historical
//!     reproduction only. PR 8 freezes the dep direction `arch-qwen35 →
//!     runtime`, but accepts that today's spec is not generic enough to
//!     live above the arch boundary.
//!
//! The `arch` module exposes the trait impl for use by the runtime's
//! daemon and other consumers via `hipfire_arch_qwen35::Qwen35`.

// Qwen3.5 is a hybrid DeltaNet + FullAttention architecture; all the
// runtime infrastructure it touches is `deltanet`-gated. When the parent
// build doesn't enable the feature, the crate is a no-op stub. This keeps
// `cargo build --no-default-features` working and matches the gating that
// was on `engine::qwen35` pre-Phase-2.
