//! G6: batched Escha-W2 prefill against the per-token route, whole model.
//!
//! This is the gate specified in task-perf-2 §5.4. It runs ONE prompt through
//! the model twice — once through `forward_prefill_batch` (batched) and once
//! through the per-token `forward` loop the non-batched route is byte-identical
//! to — and reports what changed.
//!
//! # What must be equal, what must not be, and why
//!
//! The routed (escha) half is asserted EQUAL, bit-for-bit, by
//! `escha_moe_block_gate` (G4): `escha_routed_prefill_indexed` differs from
//! `escha_routed_decode_indexed` only in `slots`, and every kernel in that
//! pipeline is purely slot-parallel — slot `s` performs the same FLOPs in the
//! same order whether the launch carried 8 slots or 2 048. That is a real
//! equality claim and it is asserted as equality there, not as a tolerance.
//!
//! The DENSE half is NOT bit-identical and cannot be. Batched prefill runs the
//! attention projections, the router and the shared expert as batched WMMA
//! GEMMs (`gemm_q8_0_residual_wmma`, `gemm_f16_wmma_mb8`, ...) where the
//! per-token route runs batch-1 GEMVs. A 16x16x16 WMMA tile accumulates a
//! different K-order than a warp-reduced GEMV, so the two disagree at the
//! last bits of every dot product and the difference compounds across 40
//! layers. That is a summation-order difference, not a defect.
//!
//! So the whole-model claim this gate can make is: the final-token logits
//! agree to a MEASURED bound, and the ARGMAX does not move.
//!
//! The measured values at n=64 on escha-35b are `max|delta| = 4.393e-1` and
//! `mean|delta| = 7.160e-2`, and both are now asserted rather than printed.
//! Note that these are two orders of magnitude ABOVE what pure accumulation
//! reordering would give: the dominant term is not reordering at all but the
//! expert-selection divergence documented below, which is 24.1% of (token,
//! layer) decisions over the whole stack. A token whose expert set differs
//! computes a different hidden state, and that compounds with depth. An
//! earlier version of this file quoted "~1e-3" here; that figure describes
//! two arms with identical routing, which these are not.
//!
//! **The argmax assertion is the load-bearing one.** Do not relax this gate to
//! "max delta < tol" and stop there. A dropped H128 transform, a stale
//! activation cache, or a wrong expert-slot stride all produce finite, fluent
//! output that is wrong by ~1e-1 per element — and a tolerance chosen loosely
//! enough to absorb the real divergence can absorb those too. The argmax
//! moving is the signal. (When this port's stale-FP16-activation bug was live,
//! this gate's max delta was ~1e+1 and the argmax moved from 25760 to 220.)
//!
//! # The expert-selection divergence
//!
//! Escha's router logits pass through `router_logits_round_f16_rne` on BOTH
//! routes (that is what makes the comparison meaningful at all), but the
//! logits fed to it differ, so some decisions land on the other side of an f16
//! rounding boundary and the two routes legitimately select different experts.
//! That is a property of the format, not a defect — but it has to be MEASURED,
//! which is what this gate does: with `HIPFIRE_ESCHA_ROUTE_TRACE` set, both
//! arms record the `topk_indices` every MoE layer actually indexed with.
//!
//! The measured rate is **2.96-3.13% per expert slot** (24.1% of (token,
//! layer) SETS over the whole stack, 0.00% at layer 0). Task 9's design-time
//! estimate was ~0.42%, i.e. 8x low, and it was low because it modelled the
//! wrong term: the dominant perturbation is not f32 accumulation reordering
//! but the **f16 downcast** the batched dense half applies to its activations
//! for the WMMA GEMMs, which the per-token F32 GEMV route does not. See the
//! design doc §10.5(b). Do not re-quote 0.42% anywhere.
//!
//! # State reset between the arms
//!
//! The DeltaNet recurrent state is the only thing that carries between the two
//! arms, and it must not: arm B would otherwise start from the state arm A
//! left behind and the comparison would be meaningless. A fresh
//! `DeltaNetState` is allocated for each arm rather than zeroing in place, so
//! "reset" means exactly what a fresh process means. The KV cache needs no
//! reset — arm B prefills from position 0 and rewrites the same slots, and
//! attention only reads positions below its own `start_pos + n`.
//!
//! COST: loads the whole model, ~37.6 GB resident.
//!

    //   the embedding they start from is identical. It is NOT a matched-input
    //   measurement — by the time layer 0's router runs, the hidden state has
    //   already been through the batched attention projections AND the batched
    //   GDN recurrence, whose Q8 state requant is documented as

    //   requant term and see what is left. This is still the number to assert
    //   on, because it is the one that cannot have compounded.
    // * Layers 1.. see inputs that already differ, because a flip at layer L
    //   changes that token's hidden state for every later layer. The rate
    //   therefore COMPOUNDS with depth and plateaus. That is arithmetic, not
    //   a defect, and it would happen on any model whose batched prefill is

    // Until now `max_d` and `mean_d` were computed and only PRINTED, so the
    // bound the module docs call load-bearing was enforced by a human reading
    // stdout. That is not enforcement, and the defect this gate exists to
    // catch produced ~1e+1 in exactly this quantity.
    //
    // THE BOUNDS BELOW ARE MEASURED, not derived from the "~1e-3" figure this
    // file used to quote. At n=64 on this model the actual values are
    //
    //     max|delta|  = 4.393e-1        mean|delta| = 7.160e-2
    //
    // reproduced identically across builds. The old ~1e-3 estimate described
    // pure accumulation reordering with IDENTICAL routing on both arms, and
    // that is not what these two arms do: 24.1% of (token, layer) routing
    // decisions differ between them (see the divergence report above). A
    // token routed to a different expert set computes a genuinely different
    // hidden state, and 40 layers of that lands two orders of magnitude above
    // the reordering-only figure. The estimate was wrong, not the run.
    //
    // So the headroom here is real but narrow: 4.4e-1 measured against the
    // ~1e+1 the stale-FP16-activation bug produced is a factor of ~23, and the
    // bound has to sit inside it. 2.0 is ~4.6x above the measurement and ~5x
    // below the known-bad value — the honest split. The mean is the steadier
    // statistic (it is an average over 248 320 logits rather than one extreme
    // order statistic), so it is bounded more tightly at ~7x headroom.
    //
    // This bound is NOT what makes the gate work; the argmax assertion below
    // is. What it adds is a trip-wire for a structural error that happens not
    // to move the argmax on this one prompt.
