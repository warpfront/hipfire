//! # hipfire-generate
//!
//! Per-architecture generation bodies, lifted out of the daemon binary.
//!
//! ## Why this crate exists
//!
//! `daemon.rs` carried 17 `generate_*` functions — roughly 25k lines — that
//! each reach into an architecture crate directly. That is the last thing
//! keeping the daemon's arch-crate reference count above zero.
//!
//! They could not simply move down. `hipfire-loader` has the 11 arch
//! dependencies but sits *below* `hipfire-engine`; `hipfire-engine` sits above
//! the loader but is deliberately arch-free (0 arch deps). The bodies need
//! both sides, so they need a layer above both:
//!
//! ```text
//! saddle-core -> hipfire-runtime -> hipfire-loader -> hipfire-engine
//!                -> hipfire-generate -> hipfire-daemon
//! ```
//!
//! ## Module ownership during the re-layering
//!
//! Grouped by architecture family so each module has exactly one owning agent
//! and the three can be filled concurrently without collision. This file and
//! `Cargo.toml` are scaffold-owned and belong to no agent.

/// Helpers shared by more than one family — the tail that made the first
/// three-way split fail. Single owner; families depend on it and never on
/// each other.
pub mod common;

/// The generic autoregressive generate path — the fallback every model
/// without a specialised route takes, and the last daemon code that
/// manipulates architecture types directly.
pub mod ar;

/// Qwen3.5/3.6 family: the multi-token path, native MTP, speculative and
/// DFlash routes, and expert-parallel. The largest group —
/// `generate_multi` alone is ~5,300 lines.
pub mod qwen;

/// DeepSeek-V4 plus the smaller dense and MoE architectures: LFM2.5,
/// MiniMax-M2, Cohere2-MoE, Gemma4, Muse Glimmer, Qwen2, LLaMA.
pub mod dense;

/// Image generation: the `img_generate` wire body (FLUX.1/FLUX.2),
/// including reference-image decode and the GPU/CPU denoise split.
pub mod img;
/// Vision and OCR: Qwen3.5-VL and dots.ocr, including the text-only
/// dots.ocr path.
pub mod vision;

/// Redline capture/replay fixtures lifted out of the daemon.
pub mod redline;

/// Continuous-batch drivers and their admission predicates.
pub mod batch;
