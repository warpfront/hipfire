//! SP7 gate: more concurrent requests than slots, each streamed independently.
//!
//! This is the first test that submits genuinely concurrent requests the way a
//! client would — six threads against a four-slot engine — and checks each gets
//! its own stream. It is the programme's headline claim ("3-4 agents at once on
//! one GPU") stated as an assertion.
//!
//! Three things it must rule out:
//!
//!   * a client receiving nothing,
//!   * every client receiving the SAME tokens, which would mean the sessions
//!     are sharing state rather than being isolated,
//!   * six requests fitting in four slots without pressure, which would mean
//!     the test never exercised admission at all.
