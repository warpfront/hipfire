//! ChatML prompt framing — single source of truth for assembling
//! the token sequence that gets fed to the model. Replaces the three
//! near-copies that lived in daemon.rs (AR, PFlash, DFlash paths).
//!
//! The canonical layout for a single turn is:
//!
//! ```text
//! [<|im_start|> system \n <system content> <|im_end|> \n]?  ← optional
//!  <|im_start|> user \n <user content> <|im_end|> \n
//!  <|im_start|> assistant \n [<think> \n]?
//! ```
//!
//! All three daemon copies converge to this exact byte sequence. The
//! AR path's whitespace conventions are canonical because it is the
//! most-exercised and the path against which the locked speed/coherence
//! baselines were captured.
//!
//! Multi-turn extends the same pattern by repeating
//! `<|im_start|> {user|assistant} \n <content> <|im_end|> \n`
//! for each prior turn before appending the new turn + assistant prefix.
//!
//! # Per-call-site policy
//!
//! Whether to *include* a system message on a given call (e.g. only on
//! `seq_pos == 0`) is the **caller's** decision. `ChatFrame` simply
//! emits a system block iff `system` is `Some`. The daemon is
//! responsible for passing `Some(_)` only on the appropriate turn.
//!
//! # Raw bypass
//!
//! `raw: true` skips ChatML scaffolding entirely and returns the
//! tokenization of `user` alone. This supports completion-style use
//! against a base model where any `<|im_start|>` token would be
//! out-of-distribution.

// `JinjaChatFrame` renders the actual `chat_template` shipped with the
// model (via the .hfq metadata blob). When the template is present this
// is strictly more correct: the model sees the exact prefix shape it
// was trained on, including default system prompts, `<think>\n` openers
// gated by `enable_thinking`, tool-call scaffolding, and any other
// per-arch quirks the upstream tokenizer_config encodes.

// Failure modes (template parse error, missing context var, explicit
// `raise_exception`) bubble up as `Err(String)` so the caller can fall
// back to `ChatFrame::Plain` rather than panicking.
//
// The render output is a plain UTF-8 string. Tokenization goes through
// `Tokenizer::encode` which recognizes registered special tokens
// (`<|im_start|>`, `<|im_end|>`, `<think>`, etc.) and emits their
// single-token IDs — so the rendered string round-trips to the same
// token sequence the model would see under transformers' apply_chat_template.
