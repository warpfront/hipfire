//! CPU-side router replica (MAD-93 v0.1).
//!
//! Replicates the per-layer MoE router GEMV on CPU so the
//! [`crate::weight_pager::WeightPager`] knows which experts are active without
//! forcing a GPU→CPU sync inside the forward path. The actual GPU still runs
//! the fused router GEMV — the CPU result is used purely for *scheduling*
//! (which experts to ensure resident, which to evict, which to prefetch).
//!
//! ## Why CPU
//!
//! The router is small: for Qwen3.5-MoE-A3B it's `[256, 2048]` per layer ≈
//! 256 KB stored as F32. 36 layers ≈ 9 MB total. Trivially fits in L2/L3
//! plus a slice in RAM. A CPU GEMV of `256×2048` floats is ~512K FMAs ≈
//! 50-100 µs on a Zen 2 — much smaller than a single MoE GEMV on GPU
//! (~5 ms). So adding it to the forward critical path costs basically
//! nothing.
//!
//! What we get in return: the *scheduler* (CPU) knows top-k expert indices
//! for layer N as soon as `x_norm` for layer N is available, with no GPU
//! readback. That's the precondition for predictive prefetch in later
//! commits.
//!
//! ## v0.1 scope
//!
//! - F32 router weights (no on-CPU quant; we just dequantize once at load).
//! - Single-threaded GEMV (rayon parallelism comes later if profiling shows
//!   it matters; per-call work is small enough that thread setup may dominate).
//! - Top-k via partial sort (k=8 out of 256, partial_sort beats heap for
//!   tiny k).
//! - No softmax — we only need the *indices*, and softmax is monotonic, so
//!   top-k by raw logits matches top-k by post-softmax weights.
