//! DDTree: tree-structured speculative verification built from DFlash's
//! per-position draft marginals.
//!
//! Port of Ringel & Romano's Algorithm 1 (MIT-licensed reference at
//! `github.com/liranringel/ddtree`, cached locally at `/tmp/ddtree_ref/`).
//! The reference is PyTorch; this is a pure-Rust port of the tree-construction
//! and greedy-walk logic. The target-verify stage is separate (lives in
//! `speculative::spec_step_ddtree`) because the hybrid Qwen3.5 architecture
//! (24 DeltaNet + 8 FullAttention layers) forces a per-branch DFS walk
//! with state snapshot/restore rather than the reference's single-pass
//! batched tree attention — LA layers don't accept an attention mask, so
//! "run the whole tree in one forward" would pollute recurrent state.
//!
//! What this module owns:
//!   - `DdTree` construction from per-position top-K (token, log-prob) pairs
//!   - Visibility matrix (ancestor-only)
//!   - `follow_verified_tree` — greedy walk selecting the longest accepted path
//!
//! What it doesn't own:
//!   - Target forwards (those live in `speculative::spec_step_ddtree`)
//!   - KV compaction (same)
//!   - Draft-side top-K extraction (computed in the caller from DFlash logits)
