//! source callback supplies already-resolved bytes and dtype, the store uploads
//! them, and the first failure explicitly rolls back every resident buffer.
//!
//! The store is not a model owner. It has no `Drop` implementation and never
//! frees GPU buffers implicitly. A carrier moves a committed transaction into
//! its existing `ArchModel` owner; that owner consumes the architecture-private
//! attached owner during the existing teardown path.
//! `WeightStoreAssembly::take` transfers a resident handle to the owner that is
//! assembling typed weights, and therefore removes the cell from the store's
//! cleanup set.
