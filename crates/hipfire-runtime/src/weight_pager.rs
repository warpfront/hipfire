//! Weight pager — runtime residency management for MoE/dense weights (MAD-93 v0.1).
//!
//! Hipfire today loads all weights to VRAM at startup. For models that exceed
//! VRAM (Qwen3.5-REAP-97B-A10B is the v0.1 target), we need to keep most experts
//! on host (read from the HFQ file) and page them in to VRAM on demand based on
//! routing decisions made by [`crate::cpu_router::CpuRouter`].
//!
//! ## Architecture (foundational)
//!
//! - **CPU is the scheduler authority.** [`CpuRouter`](crate::cpu_router::CpuRouter)
//!   replicates the per-layer router GEMV on CPU so we know top-k expert indices
//!   without a GPU→CPU sync inside the forward path. The pager consumes those
//!   indices and decides what to fetch / evict.
//! - **Transport is abstracted.** Today it's pread + `hipMemcpyAsync`
//!   ([`PreadH2DTransport`]). In a future commit we drop in
//!   `IoUringP2PTransport` for true NVMe→VRAM DMA without changing anything
//!   above this layer.
//! - **Stable per-weight identity.** [`WeightId`] is a small, hashable enum so
//!   the residency map and the (file_offset, byte_len) lookup table can be
//!   keyed identically. This is what an io_uring submission queue would consume
//!   directly.
//! - **Pager owns its VRAM.** All paged weight allocations route through the
//!   pager (not ad-hoc `gpu.alloc_tensor`), so we can later export the slabs as
//!   `dma_buf` for P2P DMA without reorganizing call sites.
//!
//! ## v0.1 scope
//!
//! - [`Transport`] trait + [`PreadH2DTransport`] impl
//! - [`WeightPager`] with residency map and `ensure_resident` (synchronous, no
//!   real eviction yet — assumes VRAM is large enough)
//! - [`WeightId`] schema covering MoE experts, dense attention, norms, embeds
//!
//! Real eviction, async transfer overlap, and predictive prefetch land in
//! follow-up commits — the trait shapes here are the seams those commits plug
//! into without changing the forward path.
