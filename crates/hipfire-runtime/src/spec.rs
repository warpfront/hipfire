//! Transparent speculative-decode seam.
//!
//! The daemon's decode loop drives a `&mut dyn Speculator` and never learns
//! which drafter/mode (DFlash chain, DDTree tree, DeepSeek4 MTP, future
//! n-gram / EAGLE) is in use. Adding a drafter is a bounded-context change:
//! implement [`Speculator`] and register one arm in the loader's
//! `build_speculator` — no daemon edits.
//!
//! This is the arch-generic boundary anticipated by the `hipfire-arch-qwen35`
//! crate docs ("speculative.rs will become arch-generic"): the trait and the
//! unified result live here in the arch-agnostic runtime, while the
//! arch-coupled impls (which need `qwen35::*` / `deepseek4::*` symbols) stay in
//! their arch crates and `impl` this trait under the orphan rule.
//!
//! Status: the trait, the unified [`SpecStep`] result, and the borrowed-target /
//! erased-grammar interfaces are live. The daemon's DFlash decode loop drives a
//! `&mut dyn Speculator` (`examples/daemon.rs::generate_dflash`), with the
//! loader's `DflashSpeculator` as the sole impl. Still future work: a generic
//! `build_speculator` registry (dispatch on arch/draft kind) and additional
//! drafters (n-gram, MTP, EAGLE) — the AR one-token path still runs through
//! `generate()`, not this trait.
