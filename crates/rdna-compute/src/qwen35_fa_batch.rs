//! S6-fa-prep-q8-pair launchers: batched full-attention prep and paired Q8
//! K/V cache writes for gfx1100 DFlash verify.
//!
//! Both kernels are bit-exact folds of the launches they replace (see the
//! `.hip` headers); admission (gfx1100, `DflashFusionCtx::ChainVerify`,
//! exact 16Q/2K or 24Q/4K + HD256 + NROT64 shapes, kill switch) is enforced
//! by the `batch_chunk_full_attn_prepare` caller and the `KvWriteQ8_0Batched`
//! dispatch arm. The launchers only validate shapes and enqueue via
//! `launch_maybe_blob` with a retained `KernargBlob`, so they stay
//! hipGraph-capture safe.
//!
//! Kernel sources are `include_str!`'d here (not via `crate::kernels`) so
//! this slice never edits the shared kernel registry owned by the scaffold.
