//
// Single source of truth for resolving `HIPFIRE_ATTN_TILE_SIZE`. Before this
// function existed, three call sites (the `launch_asym_flash_batched` kernel
// launcher in `attention.rs`, and two spots in the multi-slot microbench)
// each hand-copied the identical parse-and-validate logic, with comments
// saying "MUST mirror ... exactly". That duplication is what let a
// hardcoded `128` divisor silently drift out of sync with the launcher's own
// resolution and undersize the `partials` buffer, corrupting device memory
// (see `.superpowers/sdd/task-8-report.md`'s "Defect found and fixed"
// section for the illegal-memory-access this caused). Every caller that
// needs this value MUST go through this function instead of re-deriving it.

// NOTE: the batched-attention tile size resolver lives on `Gpu::attn_tile_size()`
// (crates/rdna-compute/src/dispatch.rs), not here. `kv_slots` is production
// `src/`, where scripts/check-env-docs.py forbids direct HIPFIRE_* reads —
// they must route through a central config reader (feature_flags.rs).

// ── Memory preflight ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// On 2026-08-07 the SP1 harnesses drove nine GLOBAL OOM kills on the dev box,
// killing the user's applications (steamwebhelper, teams-for-linux, slack,
// Firefox) rather than the benchmark. On Strix Halo the GPU's GTT is system
// RAM and the box has NO SWAP, so an overshoot does not degrade — it goes
// straight to the global OOM killer, which picks victims by oom_score, not by
// culpability.
//
// `scripts/run-bounded.sh` is the hard backstop (a cgroup, so a kill lands on
// us). This function is the first line of defence: refuse cheaply and clearly
// BEFORE allocating, so a bad configuration reports itself instead of dying
// half-way through and leaving the GPU in an unknown state.
//
// The defence is Strix-shaped, so the host-headroom half is configurable —
// `memory.oom_guard` (compat `HIPFIRE_OOM_GUARD`), default `auto`:
//   - unified-memory APU arch (gfx1151 etc.) → guard ON: GPU allocations come
//     out of system RAM, so the refusal protects the desktop;
//   - discrete-GPU arch (gfx1100 etc.) → guard OFF: an overshoot is a plain
//     failed hipMalloc, failing one request, not the box;
//   - no GPU arch known (e.g. the CLI supervising a daemon) → decided by host
//     swap state: with swap an overcommit degrades rather than kills;
//   - explicit `true`/`false` overrides the decision either way.
// The R9700 deployment-target budget above is NOT configurable: it always
// applies, on every arch, with the guard on or off.

/// does not fit here cannot ship, regardless of what this 125 GiB dev box can
