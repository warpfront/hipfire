    //
    // Structurally identical to the four MQ2/MQ3-Lloyd launchers above except
    // for two things, both of which are silent-corruption traps if got wrong:
    //
    //  1. KERNARG ORDER. The GL kernels carry the tensor-global codebook as
    //     SCALAR FLOAT args between the pointers and the trailing `int M, int
    //     K` — 4 floats for MQ2-GL (`GL_CB2`), 8 for MQ3-GL (`GL_CB3`). The
    //     Lloyd siblings have no such args (their codebook is a per-group fp16
    //     header inside the weight blob). Order below is transcribed from the
    //     `extern "C"` signatures in
    //     `kernels/src/gemv_mq{2,3}g256gl_moe_{gate_up,down}_indexed.hip` and
    //     matches the on-GPU-verified blobs in
    //     `rdna-compute/examples/bench_mq{2,3}g256gl_moe_*.rs`.
    //
    //  2. WEIGHT SIZE. The blob is SoA — `M*gpr*IDX` index bytes followed by
    //     `M*gpr*2` fp16 scale bytes — not `M*gpr*STRIDE` of interleaved
    //     groups. Only the profile-timer byte counters read this, but keeping
    //     it honest keeps the GB/s numbers comparable to the Lloyd siblings.
