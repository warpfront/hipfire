# hipfire

LLM inference for AMD RDNA GPUs. Rust + HIP. Single binary. No Python
in the hot path. Ollama-style UX.

```bash
hipfire pull qwen3.5:9b
hipfire run  qwen3.5:9b "What is the capital of France?"
hipfire serve -d        # background daemon, OpenAI-compatible API on :11435
```

Current release: **v0.1.20** — engine modularization. See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

## Why

`llama.cpp + ROCm` works on RDNA but is painful: upstream ROCm
officially supports only a handful of datacenter cards; consumer RDNA
is a second-class citizen. hipfire targets the entire RDNA family
(RDNA1 → RDNA4, consumer + pro + APU) with a single Rust binary that
ships pre-compiled kernel blobs when possible and JIT-compiles the
rest through HIP. No Python, no PyTorch, no ROCm userspace stack at
runtime.

## Headline numbers — 7900 XTX (gfx1100)

Decode tok/s, default config (asym3 KV, FlashAttention auto):

| Model | hipfire decode | hipfire prefill (peak) | vs ollama Q4_K_M |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Qwen 3.5 0.8B | **391** | 7383 | **2.10×** decode |
| Qwen 3.5 4B | **180** | 2487 | **1.78×** decode |
| Qwen 3.5 9B | **132** | 1663 | **1.71×** decode |
| Qwen 3.5 27B | **47** | 478 | — |

DFlash speculative decode lifts code prompts further: **218 tok/s peak
on 27B HumanEval/53** (4.45× over AR), **372 tok/s peak on 9B**.
DFlash speedup is genre-conditional — see
[docs/BENCHMARKS.md](docs/BENCHMARKS.md) for the full per-genre table
and the cross-arch matrix (RDNA1 / RDNA2 / APU / MI300X).

## Install

Linux with ROCm 6+:

```bash
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kaden-Schutt/hipfire/master/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

For Windows, source builds, and verifying the install:
[docs/GETTING_STARTED.md](docs/GETTING_STARTED.md).

## NixOS

First-class support via Nix flake. See [docs/NIXOS.md](docs/NIXOS.md).

```bash
nix develop github:Kaden-Schutt/hipfire  # dev shell with Rust + ROCm + bun
nix build github:Kaden-Schutt/hipfire    # build package
```

NixOS module:

```nix
{
  inputs.hipfire.url = "github:Kaden-Schutt/hipfire";
  # then in configuration.nix:
  services.hipfire.enable = true;
  services.hipfire.gpuTargets = [ "gfx1100" ];
}
```

## Inspiration: Lucebox

hipfire's DFlash work was substantially shaped by Davide Ciffa's
[Lucebox DFlash on ggml](https://www.lucebox.com/blog/dflash27b) — a
standalone C++/ggml/CUDA DFlash for Qwen 3.5-27B on a single RTX 3090.
Different stack, different vendor — but Lucebox's blog gave us
concrete published numbers to target, n_gen-aware bench methodology,
and pointers at where the fat is. Cached snapshot at
`.research-cache/lucebox-dflash27b.html` for forensic reproducibility.

## Inspiration: gfx906 (MI50/MI60) optimizations

hipfire's gfx906 prefill MMQ kernel and AR-decode optimizations were
shaped by two community forks of `llama.cpp` that target Vega 20:

- **[iacopPBK/llama.cpp-gfx906](https://github.com/iacopPBK/llama.cpp-gfx906)**
  — the original fork that ported and tuned gfx906-specific code paths
  (warp-cooperative GEMV via half-wave split, Y-tile prefetch via
  inline-asm `global_load_dword`, `__builtin_amdgcn_readfirstlane`-based
  SGPR hoisting, separate HBM-load → register-cache → LDS-store
  pipelining in the MMQ body). The "2602.01 version" commit
  `eec153c086df6a9e7a69499bea3639597c085fff` was the canonical reference
  we audited against.
- **[skyne98/llama.cpp-gfx906](https://github.com/skyne98/llama.cpp-gfx906)**
  — fork-of-fork that propagates iacop's optimizations (commit
  `42c298c` "port iacop optimizations") and tracks upstream more
  aggressively. The accompanying
  [skyne98/wiki-gfx906](https://skyne98.github.io/wiki-gfx906/intro.html)
  is the best public reference for gfx906 ISA quirks (LDS bank-conflict
  patterns at stride 32, dp4a issue-rate ceiling, Q8_1 activation
  layout) — we used it as a sanity-check for several PMC-driven
  redesign decisions.

And of course an extra shout-out to `ggml-org/llama.cpp` itself: the
templated `mmq_x` body in `mul_mat_q.cu` was the architectural scaffold
we ported to gfx906 (templated mmq_x ladder, per-thread accumulator
layout, MMQ_TILE_NE_K=32 sub-block factoring, Q8_1 quantize math). The
inner loop is gfx906-specific; the outer shape is descendant.

## Contributing

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md). Any change to kernels, quant
formats, dispatch, fusion, rotation, rmsnorm, or the spec-decode path
must pass `./scripts/coherence-gate-dflash.sh` before commit. The
canonical correctness gate is per-arch channel-test; the speed-gate
catches regressions on the baseline arch. Don't bypass either with
`--no-verify` — see
[methodology/perf-benchmarking.md](docs/methodology/perf-benchmarking.md).
