# coherence-gate-minimax.sh — MiniMax-M2 prefill coherence gate via the DAEMON
# chat template (the real serving path), not raw greedy prompts.
#
# Sends a diverse prompt matrix as chat `messages` so the daemon renders the
# MiniMax chat template → the model answers and emits EOS naturally (no greedy
# rambling). Runs the production path with no env levers: short prompts use the
# per-token indexed MoE GEMV, while the long passage (>=256 rows/chunk) drives
# the scatter-grouped MoE prefill (i8 on gfx1151 by arch). Both must stay
# coherent.
#
# Hard-fails (exit 1) if any request's visible chat output is degenerate:
#   - zero tokens, OR max single-word frequency > 0.50 (true attractor), OR
#     unique-word ratio < 0.30 (structural loop), OR a daemon panic/error.
# Chat-templated answers are clean, so these thresholds reflect real failures
# (unlike the raw-prompt example battery, where greedy repetition is expected).
#
# Exit: 0 PASS, 1 degenerate/regression, 2 infra (build/lock/panic), 3 skipped.

  "Read the following passage and then summarize it in one sentence. \
Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants, algae, and some bacteria \
convert light energy into chemical energy stored in glucose. It takes place in \
the chloroplasts, which contain the pigment chlorophyll. The process has two \
main stages. In the light-dependent reactions, energy from sunlight is captured \
and used to split water molecules, producing oxygen as a byproduct and \
generating the energy carriers ATP and NADPH. In the light-independent \
reactions, also called the Calvin cycle, the ATP and NADPH are used to fix \
carbon dioxide from the air into three-carbon sugars, which are then assembled \
into glucose. Photosynthesis is fundamental to life on Earth because it produces \
the oxygen we breathe and forms the base of nearly every food chain. The overall \
balanced equation is six carbon dioxide plus six water, in the presence of light \
energy, yielding one glucose molecule plus six oxygen molecules."
