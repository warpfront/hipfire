# SP7 integration gate: `hipfire serve` serves several agents at once.
#
# Everything else in this programme is tested in-process. This is the only
# test that exercises what an agent actually touches: the real binary, the
# real config path (serve.multi_slot), real HTTP, real OpenAI-compatible
# JSON, and the admission gate in front of the engine.
#
# It asserts three things, and each one has failed for real during
# development:
#
#   * every request returns HTTP 200 with non-empty content
#       (the terminal callback was once never invoked -> "generation worker
#        disconnected" on every request)
#   * the answers are DISTINCT
#       (DeltaNet state was once not reset on slot reuse, so every request
#        after the first echoed the previous conversation)
#   * concurrent is materially faster than sequential
#       (the HTTP admission gate was a single busy flag, so requests
#        serialised even though the engine could take four)
#
# Harness rules encoded here, learned the hard way:
#   * liveness is `ss -ltn`, never `pgrep -f` — a `pgrep -f` pattern that
#     appears in the checking command's own argv matches itself
#   * concurrent waits use explicit PIDs, never bare `wait`, which would
#     also wait on the backgrounded server
#   * teardown kills the server's CHILDREN, not just the run-bounded
#     wrapper — killing the wrapper leaves the model resident and every
#     later run is refused by the memory gate
#
# Usage: scripts/serve_concurrency_gate.sh [model_path] [port]
