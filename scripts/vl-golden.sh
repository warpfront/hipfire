# Vision-language decoded-text golden.
#
# Runs a VL model against a committed image and asserts the decoded text is
# BYTE-IDENTICAL to a committed fixture. This is the check that guarded every
# structural step of the saddle arch-contract refactor: loader, dispatch and
# model-storage changes must not perturb a single byte of decoded output.
#
# It is deliberately NOT built on coherence_probe or any capture harness. It
# runs the shipped `hipfire` binary the way a user does, compares bytes, and
# exits non-zero on drift. Nothing else.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/vl-golden.sh                 # dots-ocr (the committed fixture)
#   scripts/vl-golden.sh --refresh       # rewrite the fixture from this build
#
# Exit codes: 0 pass or skipped-clean, 1 drift, 2 harness/model problem.
