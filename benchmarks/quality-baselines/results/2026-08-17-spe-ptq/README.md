# SP-E — runtime-free low-bit PTQ of Qwen3.6-27B vs PrismML Bonsai

**Date:** 2026-08-17 · **Host:** gfx1151 · **Slice:** wikitext2-1024s-2048ctx,
8 chunks × n_ctx 512 (2040 scored tokens/arm) · **KV:** asym3 ·
**Scoring:** per-token

**Teacher / reference:** `qwen3.6-27b.mq4` via `build_kld_ref_native`
(top-256, 32 chunks). Every arm is scored against this one reference and its
token stream. KLD is therefore **distance from the mq4 teacher**, not from
FP16 — an arm cannot score below the teacher's own quantization error.

## Results

| Variant | bits | Mean KLD ± 95% CI | PPL | Generates? |
|---|---|---|---:|---|
| bonsai-ternary (PrismML) | 2.125 | **0.5363** (0.4223–0.6715) | 16.69 | yes — coherent reasoning → "Paris" |
| bonsai-binary (PrismML) | 1.14 | **0.6292** (0.5476–0.7226) | 17.76 | yes (per SP-B) |
| spe-tq2-awqim (ours + AWQ imatrix) | 2.125 | 2.2418 (2.0376–2.3978) | 86.57 | **no** — emits `<think>` then EOS |
| spe-tq2-sweep (ours, uniform) | 2.125 | 5.1007 (4.9463–5.2548) | 1436.38 | **no** — multilingual token soup |
| spe-bq1-sweep (ours, uniform) | 1.14 | 7.9984 (7.7765–8.2272) | 30183.40 | no |
| spe-bq1-awqim (ours + AWQ imatrix) | 1.14 | 8.4162 (8.0920–8.7121) | 45482.57 | no |

Reference points: the mq4 teacher scores NLL ≈ 2.00 on this slice; uniform over
the 248320-token vocab is NLL 11.9 / KLD ≈ 12.

## Codebook controls — the decisive comparison

Added after the first pass, because the first pass drew the wrong conclusion.
Same source, same teacher, same slice; only the **codebook and rotation** vary
at a fixed ~2 bpw:

| target | bpw | codebook | rotated | KLD | PPL |
|---|---|---|---|---:|---:|
| spe-tq2-sweep | 2.125 | uniform 3-level | no | 5.1007 | 1436.38 |
| spe-mq2-uniform | 2.25 | uniform 4-level | yes | 3.9225 | 472.05 |
| spe-tq2-awqim | 2.125 | uniform 3-level + imatrix | no | 2.2418 | 86.57 |
| **spe-mq2-lloyd** | **2.25** | **Lloyd-Max non-uniform** | **yes** | **0.6125** | **17.04** |
| bonsai-ternary (PrismML) | 2.125 | uniform 3-level + *their transform* | no | 0.5363 | 16.69 |

`spe-mq2-lloyd` also **generates coherently** (clean reasoning trace → "Paris"),
unlike either ternary arm — checked because KLD alone is not sufficient (the
2.24 ternary arm looked respectable and still collapsed to an immediate EOS).

**A plain PTQ with a non-uniform per-block codebook lands within noise of
PrismML's proprietary transform** (0.61 vs 0.54 — Bonsai's CI is 0.4223-0.6715,
so at n=8 these are not distinguishable), and it generates. No transform, no calibration
corpus, no GPU pass — just Lloyd-Max centroids plus the FWHT rotation that
hipfire's MQ formats already carry.

This overturns the first pass's reading. **~2 bpw is not the problem; the fixed
uniform level set is.** The Q2_0/Q1_0 wire format pins levels to `{-d, 0, +d}`,
leaving the encoder only `d` to choose — and no amount of scale search
(5.10) or importance weighting (2.24) recovers what a free codebook gets
(0.61). Rotation alone is worth little (5.10 → 3.92); the non-uniform codebook
is what matters.

It also puts a bound on how much of Bonsai's advantage is the proprietary
transform: on this evidence, most of it is reachable with a better codebook at
the same bit budget. Note the in-tree gate for `mq2-lloyd` records "still
collapse (9B ppl 2163)" — that verdict does not reproduce here at 27B, so it is
either model-size-specific or stale.

## Width sweep — where the uniform codebook actually fails

| target | bpw | codebook | KLD | PPL |
|---|---|---|---:|---:|
| mq4 (the teacher itself) | 4.25 | uniform 16-level | 0.0000 | 7.42 |
| spe-mq3-control | 3.25 | uniform 8-level | **0.2767** | 13.02 |
| bonsai-ternary (PrismML) | 2.125 | uniform 3-level + transform | 0.5363 | 16.69 |
| spe-mq2-lloyd | 2.25 | Lloyd non-uniform 4-level | 0.6125 | 17.04 |
| spe-tq2-awqim | 2.125 | uniform 3-level + imatrix | 2.2418 | 86.57 |
| spe-mq2-uniform | 2.25 | uniform 4-level | 3.9225 | 472.05 |
| spe-tq2-sweep | 2.125 | uniform 3-level | 5.1007 | 1436.38 |

A **uniform** codebook is fine at 8 levels (3 bpw, KLD 0.28) and falls apart at
4 and 3 levels. The cliff is between 3 and 2 bits, and a non-uniform codebook
steps across it.

Practical reading for this checkpoint: **MQ3 is the best quality/bit trade
available by plain PTQ (0.28 at 3.25 bpw), and MQ2-Lloyd is the floor that
still works (0.61 at 2.25 bpw).** PrismML's transformed ternary sits between
them at 2.125 bpw — better than our 2.25 bpw Lloyd by 0.08 nats, and worse than
plain MQ3. It is a real but modest edge, not a different league.

**Practical consequence for SP-E: reproducing PrismML's transform is not
required to ship a working ~2 bpw 27B.** `--format mq2lloyd` already gets
there. The remaining honest gap is artifact SIZE, not quality: 8.58 GB vs
Bonsai's 7.16 GB (+20%), because our requant keeps `embed_tokens` at 4-bit and
retains the AWQ sidecars, while Bonsai quantizes embeddings too. Closing that
is a per-tensor precision-policy change, not a codebook problem.

## Findings

**1. The AWQ sidecars are a usable imatrix, and worth 2.3× at 2 bits.**
`compute_awq_scales` emits `s = C·in_sum2^(α/2)`, so `in_sum2 ∝ s^(2/α)` and the
per-tensor constant cancels inside the packers' per-block argmin. Using it as
column importance moved ternary from KLD 5.10 → **2.24** with no GPU pass, no
llama.cpp, and no tensor-name mapping. (α is assumed 0.55 — it is not recorded
in any .hfq; a wrong α re-sharpens the weighting but preserves channel
ordering.)

**2. At 1 bit the same imatrix slightly HURTS** (7.998 → 8.416). Consistent
with the mechanism: with no zero level, column weighting can only move the
single magnitude `d`, whereas at 2 bits it decides *which columns get zeroed* —
which is where the leverage is.

**3. KLD 2.24 is still not a working model.** Both ternary arms fail
generation under the same command that produces a full coherent trace from
Bonsai. This is the headline caveat: a mid-range KLD does not imply usability,
and no arm here should be reported as "close to Bonsai" on the strength of the
number alone. **Always pair the KLD with a generation smoke.**

**4. The limitation is the wire format's fixed level set, not PrismML's
transform.** An earlier draft of this document concluded the opposite — that
the behaviour-preserving transform was doing the essential work and plain PTQ
could not approach it. The codebook controls refute that: `mq2lloyd` reaches
KLD 0.612 and generates, against Bonsai's 0.536, at the same bit budget with no
transform. What our ternary arms were fighting is that Q2_0/Q1_0 pin the levels
to `{-d, 0, +d}` and leave the encoder only `d`.

Bonsai's remaining edge over `mq2lloyd` is 0.08 nats — inside the n=8 CI — at
0.125 fewer bpw and a 20% smaller artifact. Real, but a size/packing edge
rather than a quality tier. Their *1-bit* model (0.629) is the more impressive
result: nothing we produce at 1 bit is usable (7.998 best), and that gap is
not explained by codebook choice.

## Port fidelity — hipfire vs llama.cpp on byte-identical weights

The arms above are scored against a hipfire-native teacher, which measures
model-vs-model distance, NOT whether our port of Bonsai is faithful. That
needed its own check: score our byte-verbatim `ternary-bonsai-27b.hfq` against
**PrismML's own llama.cpp running the same GGUF**, on llama's tokens, f32 KV.

```
build_kld_ref --bf16-gguf Ternary-Bonsai-27B-Q2_0.gguf --n-ctx 512 --top-k 256 \
    --llama-perplexity-bin /data/prism-ref/build/bin/llama-perplexity
eval_hipfire --model ternary-bonsai-27b.hfq --ref bonsai-llamacpp.kldref.bin \
    --kv-mode f32 --scoring-mode per-token --max-chunks 4
```

**Result: mean KLD = 0.000153** (per-chunk 0.000176 / 0.000139 / 0.000191 /
0.000107; p99 ≈ 1.5e-3). Corroborated on the realized-token metric: llama.cpp's
own cumulative PPL after 4 chunks is **14.1907**, hipfire scores **14.1456** on
the same tokens — 0.3% apart.

So the ternary port is exact to numerical noise (GPU vs CPU reduction order,
fp16 storage). This also validates the whole chain independently of the
hipfire-native teacher: convert, loader, TQ2G128 GEMV, ternary lm_head,
DeltaNet forward and scoring window all agree with the reference implementation.

### This contradicts the recorded cross-engine floor

`build_kld_ref_native`'s header and
`docs/plans/2026-06-02-hfqv2-implementation/experiments/self-sufficient-eval/F2-native-eval.md`
document a "~0.30-0.36 nat" hipfire-vs-llama.cpp floor (F1 measured 0.357 nats,
87% top-1, top-256 logit cosine 0.854) and attribute it to "the two different
Gated-DeltaNet ports". That premise is why the native reference tool exists.

It does not reproduce here: **0.000153 vs a claimed 0.35 floor**, on a hybrid
model whose layers are mostly linear-attn, with byte-identical weights on both
sides — a strictly tighter control than F1's (which compared hipfire-F32
against llama-bf16).

Most likely explanation: the floor was a real hipfire bug that has since been
fixed — SP-A (2026-07-15) found and fixed exactly this class of defect, a
double-applied RMSNorm `+1` bias on qwen3.5/3.6 norms (`4af90702`), which
postdates the F1/F2 measurement. Worth re-running F1 before continuing to treat
llama-sourced references as structurally unusable; if this holds generally, the
cross-harness confound that motivated F2 is gone, and llama.cpp tooling
(imatrix, perplexity) becomes directly usable again.

## Provenance / validity

The harness was validated before any of these numbers were believed:

- **Identity control:** scoring `qwen3.6-27b.mq4` against its OWN reference
  (per-token, kv f32) gives `slice-mean KLD = 0.000000` exactly.
- **Reference soundness:** the oracle's own NLL recovered offline from the
  .kldref = 1.815 with a 96.9% top-256 hit rate and 2.1% residual mass.
- **Scoring mode:** prefill and per-token agree bit-for-bit (0.608557 both) —
  TQ2G128/BQ1G128 are not in `is_batchable_la`, so prefill takes an exact
  per-token fallback.

The superseded 2026-07-16 canary (bonsai-ternary KLD 6.15, spe-tq2-r0 KLD
13.30) is **void**: its Bonsai arm scored a .hfq built before that day's
norm-bias fix, and its PTQ arm predates the AWQ-fold, scale-sweep and
code-3 fixes. `.hfq` files now carry a `hipfire_provenance` stamp and
`spe_ablation.sh` prints it for every arm before scoring, so this class of
error is visible rather than silent.

## Reproduce

```
benchmarks/quality-baselines/harness/spe_ablation.sh full 8
```

Arm models are built with:

```
hipfire-quantize --input ~/.hipfire/models/qwen3.6-27b.mq4 \
    --output /data/hipfire-models/spe-tq2-awqim.hfq \
    --format ternary --awq-imatrix 0.55 --allow-lowbit-ptq
```

`--allow-lowbit-ptq` is required as of this run: on the strength of these
numbers, requantizing an ordinary checkpoint down to ternary/binary is now
gated by default (`lowbit_ptq_gate`), matching how `mq2` and `mq2-lloyd` are
handled. The GGUF byte-verbatim passthrough path used for Bonsai is
unaffected.
