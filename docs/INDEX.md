# Documentation index

Single hub for navigation, lifecycle classification, and ownership.
Domain prose lives in the linked owners; this file does not duplicate it.

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Inventory date | 2026-07-22 |
| Working branch | `beta` |
| Audited source ref | `202282de8759dfa6963ea5184ad2bf2b9259cef6` |
| Comparison base | `origin/beta` @ `202282de8759dfa6963ea5184ad2bf2b9259cef6` |
| Integrated commit / tree / source hashes | Supplied externally by Git/CI after cutover. Never self-referenced here. |

## Truth states

Exactly four **active** truth states apply to a current claim or surface.
Pick exactly one:

| State | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **shipped / ref-pinned** | Present on the audited source ref and treated as current product or contributor authority for that concern. |
| **branch-implemented** | Implemented or documented on a named working branch but not present in the audited beta ref. |
| **measured** | Observation tied to named fixture, binary/model identity, and date. Not a default, floor, or admission. |
| **planned** | Intent only. No executable authority and no implied schedule. |

**Historical** is a **lifecycle / evidence disposition**, not a fifth active
truth state. It means a retained record useful for provenance — not current
procedure, baseline, or product authority — unless a shipped owner re-states
the claim under one of the four active states above.

Directory and collection rows use **exactly one** canonical classification:
one of the four active states, a historical disposition, or an explicit
fail-closed marker below. When members vary, put the directory policy
classification in the State cell and explain member exceptions in
Notes/Policy. Never invent another truth state or a slash-combined policy
state. Each individual claim still takes exactly one active label, a
historical disposition, or fails closed.

Lack of authority is not an active truth state:

| Marker | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **blocked** | No single canonical owner, missing executable route, or unresolved contradiction. Fail closed. |
| **superseded / rejected** | Replaced or declined; keep only as history. Do not promote. |
| **unknown** | Not classified. Fail closed — do not invent an owner, admission, or gate. |
| **historical** (disposition) | Retained evidence or archive. Not an active authority label. |

**Fail-closed:** if a concern has no row below, or a row is `blocked` /
`unknown`, do not treat any nearby doc, skill, measurement, or runtime default
as authority. Open an explicit owner or keep the claim out of product language.

Admissions are machine-recorded only in [`admissions.yml`](admissions.yml) (schema v2). Exactly one evidence-bound row is admitted; every other route stays unadmitted. Runtime gating or a passing measurement alone never admits a route.

## How to use this index

1. Find the concern in [Ownership](#ownership).
2. Open that owner for mutable facts.
3. For validation or promotion evidence, use only [`VALIDATION.md`](VALIDATION.md).
4. Treat collection rows as directory policy; do not promote a file inside a historical collection by recency alone.

## Ownership

Exactly one canonical owner (or explicit `BLOCKED`) per concern.

## Collection classification

Every current top-level collection, exactly once. Directory policy applies to members that lack their own stronger metadata. One canonical policy state per collection; member exceptions go in Policy only.

| Collection | State | Policy |
|---|---|---|
| [`methodology/`](methodology/) | shipped / ref-pinned | Active methodology owners. Link; do not copy matrices into root guides. **Member exceptions:** [`astrea-atlas-pareto-workflow.md`](methodology/astrea-atlas-pareto-workflow.md) and [`astrea-model-policy.md`](methodology/astrea-model-policy.md) are **planned / blocked** (proposed intent; not current INDEX/VALIDATION owners; `candidate_id` join unsupported in current Atlas schema). |
| [`perf-checkpoints/`](perf-checkpoints/) | measured | Immutable dated evidence. Correct only with a new dated amendment file. |
| [`design/`](design/) | planned | Approved intent and drafts. Member exceptions: branch-implemented LFM/Redline docs and measured baseline notes may appear; directory is not runtime truth. |
| [`plans/`](plans/) | planned | Execution plans/PRDs. Member exceptions: measured results ledgers may appear. Recency ≠ authority. |
| [`specs/`](specs/) | planned | Narrow specs and intent; promote only via shipped owners. |
| [`investigations/`](investigations/) | historical | Historical discovery plus measured research trails. |
| [`reviews/`](reviews/) | historical | Review archives. |
| [`lessons_learned/`](lessons_learned/) | historical | Postmortems. |
| [`moe-awq/`](moe-awq/) | historical | MoE AWQ session notes. |
| [`quant-formats/`](quant-formats/) | shipped / ref-pinned | Format notes under quant umbrella; HFP4/MFP4 current surface is shipped / ref-pinned while some aliases stay planned. `QUANTIZATION.md` remains primary. |
| [`rental/`](rental/) | historical | Rental runbooks. |
| [`governance/`](governance/) | historical | Legal/governance records; bodies stay untouched. |
| [`superpowers/`](superpowers/) | planned | Nested plans/specs only; not an executable skill root. |

## Audit scope

- **Audited ref** (`202282de8759dfa6963ea5184ad2bf2b9259cef6`): beta behavior pin used for this inventory refresh.
- **Comparison base** (`origin/beta` @ `202282de8759dfa6963ea5184ad2bf2b9259cef6`): use when separating branch-only work from current beta facts.
- Branch-implemented surfaces must not be phrased as beta product facts.
- Historical, legal, and measured checkpoint bodies are not rewritten by this index.

## Explicit non-goals

- No mutable fact duplication across owners.
- No self-referencing “final” commit or tree hash in this file.
- No universal GPU/coherence replacement gate.
- No admissions inferred from benches, harness exits, or registry tags.
