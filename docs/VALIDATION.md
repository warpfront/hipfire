# Validation routes

Maps claim class → validation route. **Merge authority is direct maintainer
review backed by evidence selected for the changed behavior**, plus the
required no-GPU CI checks named below. Executable behavior lives in the
scripts and workflows named in each route. Methodology numbers and Redline
certification prose live in their owners
([`INDEX.md`](INDEX.md)).

Automation — including [`hw-gate`](../.github/workflows/hw-gate.yml) when it
runs — is **optional evidence delivery**. It is not a merge prerequisite, not
a required status check, and not a substitute for the proof the claim needs
or for an approving human review. Authors may request hardware routes with
the PR template's `<!-- hw-gate-request -->` block when that automation is
used; no local planning tool is merge evidence.

## Rules

1. Pick the **narrowest** route that covers the changed surface.
2. Every route below names an **existing** path, or is marked **blocked**.
3. **Fail closed** on unknown claim classes: do not improvise a gate, and
   do not treat a green unrelated route as coverage.
4. There is **no universal replacement gate**.
5. Harness success without the proof the claim needs is insufficient
   (especially Redline route proof — see [`REDLINE.md`](REDLINE.md)).
6. **Admissions** are recorded only in [`admissions.yml`](admissions.yml).
   A passing route does not create an admission row.
7. **Static review ≠ hardware proof.** Required no-GPU CI and a clean static
   read never substitute for GPU/model evidence the claim map requires.
   Hardware harness output never substitutes for required CI or an approving
   review.

## Merge bar (required)

Branch protection on `master` requires these CI job names from
[`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](../.github/workflows/ci.yml):

- `build (workspace, no GPU)`
- `unit tests (lib, no GPU)`
- `gates (ratchets, layering, registers)`

plus **one approving review**.

Those three jobs stay required. Do not disable them. `hw-gate` is **not**
among the required checks: a missing, skipped, or unsuccessful hw-gate run
is not a merge blocker by itself, and a successful hw-gate run is not
automatic acceptance, auto-promotion, or a substitute for the approving
review.

Every change still owes the evidence named by the [claim → route map](#claim--route-map)
for the surfaces it touches. The author or reviewer may gather that evidence
with the manual harnesses below and/or optional automation; the maintainer
who approves judges that the evidence matches the claim.

## hw-gate (optional evidence automation)

[`hw-gate`](../.github/workflows/hw-gate.yml) is optional automation that can
collect load/serve/kernel evidence and post seat commentary on a PR. It does
not approve PRs, does not replace the [merge bar](#merge-bar-required), and
does not own `master`. When it runs, two model seats may assist investigation
under their own identities (`hipfire-sol[bot]`, `hipfire-fable[bot]`); a human
still owns the approving review. Diffs that touch no hardware-relevant
surface need no hardware route.

### Bucket selection (`scripts/hw-gate/select.py`)

Changed paths → buckets `load` / `serve` / `kernel` (first match wins per path;
`serve` and `kernel` also imply `load`):

| Bucket | Path rules (summary) |
|---|---|
| **kernel** | `kernels/**`, `crates/rdna-compute/**`, `crates/hipfire-dispatch/**`, `crates/hip-bridge/**`, `crates/saddle-core/**` |
| **serve** | `crates/hipfire-engine/**`, `crates/hipfire-generate/**`, daemon `slots.rs` / `serve*.rs`, runtime emit/eos/dflash/spec/reset/triattn surfaces, arch `serve`/`generate`/`spec` sources |
| **load** | loader/daemon/runtime load+config surfaces, arch `load*`/`weights*`/`carrier.rs`, `crates/hipfire-config/**`, `crates/hipfire-registry/**`, `registry/**`, workspace/`crates/*/Cargo.toml` and lockfile |
| **none** | everything else (docs, benchmarks, most scripts, tests, markdown, …) |

Touching **policy** paths (`.github/workflows/**`, `.github/CODEOWNERS`,
`scripts/hw-gate/**`, leanup/ratchet scripts, `registry/**`) always needs a
human decision; automation must not merge those. Exec-sensitive paths (build
scripts, manifests, toolchain, CI, shell/python) are useful context for
execution-risk judgment; they are not a gate by themselves.

### The author's request (`<!-- hw-gate-request -->`)

A PR body may carry a fenced JSON block after the marker:
`{"routes":[{"mode":"battery"|"chain","tag":"registry:tag"}],"claim":"..."}`.
When hw-gate runs, Sol treats the claim as a claim, runs the requested routes
when the tag exists on the runner, reports unknown or absent tags as
unavailable (not failed), and states in its verdict whether the claim was
proven, disproven, or not exercised. The PR template ships the skeleton.
Authors may instead attach equivalent manual harness output; either path is
evidence for direct review, not an acceptance pass by itself.

### Seat 1 — Sol (when automation runs)

Sol (`openai-codex/gpt-5.6-sol`, read-only tools in a PR checkout) reads the
diff before anything runs and decides `run_hardware`: the hardware job builds
the PR and runs its daemon as the maintainer's user on their workstation, so
Sol refuses diffs that reach outside the process (network, filesystem beyond
model/cache/temp, env or credential reads, process spawning, unexplained build
or dependency changes, obfuscated blobs, unexplained `unsafe`). A maintainer's
**`hw-run`** label only ever forces a run and is removed after each run and on
every push. Sol also composes the route list: the mandatory fixtures for the
touched buckets, the author's requested routes, and its own additions.

After hardware, Sol reads every decoded turn and returns `greenlight` /
`needs-human` / `block` with regressions cited by `file:line` and fixture. Sol
never merges and never approves; its review is a comment that may inform the
human reviewer.

### Fixtures and harnesses

Every fixture runs through [`scripts/serve_harness.py`](../scripts/serve_harness.py)
— never a single `hipfire run`, which is one request against a fresh daemon
and proves nothing about turn-to-turn state — with reasoning off. Mandatory
fixtures are registry tags pinned by sha256 in
[`scripts/hw-gate/fixtures.json`](../scripts/hw-gate/fixtures.json); a
missing or mismatched pinned fixture **fails that automation run**. Requested
extra tags resolve through `registry/v1.json`; one absent from the runner is
reported as unavailable.

- **`load` bucket** — `battery` on every fixture (varied prompts, expect
  substrings, attractor / runaway / empty detection).
- **`serve` bucket** — `battery` + `chain` (related turns through the prefix
  cache: reset, cache, and terminal semantics).
- **`kernel` bucket** — `battery` plus
  [`scripts/redline_daemon_harness.py`](../scripts/redline_daemon_harness.py)
  capture + HIP/PM4 parity on the dense trunk.

Decoded assistant text is posted **verbatim** in the evidence comment. Reading
it is part of review. The per-turn prefill/decode rates in that table are
harness-side timings (HTTP streaming, sampling) and run well under
`hipfire bench`; they are context, never a performance claim. Perf claims go
through [`docs/methodology/perf-benchmarking.md`](methodology/perf-benchmarking.md).

The same harnesses are the manual evidence path when automation is not used:
run them locally, attach the artifacts, and let the maintainer review.

### Seat 2 — Fable (when automation runs)

Fable (`anthropic/claude-fable-5-1`, thinking `xhigh`) reads the diff, the
evidence, and Sol's verdict — and then, when that evidence does not prove the
change, may gather more evidence itself. It runs with a real shell in a
sandboxed checkout of the PR head on the hardware host: every hiptrx GPU is
reserved for the session (a host-level lock serializes Fable sessions and
excludes the lane runs), the PR and the base branch are both built for A/B,
every registry artifact on the host is available read-only, and everything
Fable writes to `$HW_GATE_EVIDENCE` is uploaded with its decision. There is
no fixed route vocabulary: Fable chooses what proves the change — a
multi-GPU load for new topology code, a refused-load-then-generate sequence
for a moved refusal, Redline parity for a kernel, a base-vs-PR A/B for a
"no behavior change" refactor. The sandbox bounds reach, not judgment: no
network, no writes outside its home/evidence/build tree, no other GPUs, no
credentials, no `gh` (the script posts), a wall-clock budget
(`HW_GATE_MAX_MINUTES`, default 45), and only registry artifacts.

Fable returns a decision comment with an `investigation` table
(question → route run → evidence file → result), an `unproven` list for what
this host could not exercise, and an announcement written for the author. It
may disagree with Sol and must say why. **Fable does not replace the required
approving review and does not promote `master`.** Seat commentary is input to
the maintainer, not an acceptance pass or auto-merge contract.

### The floor (`scripts/hw-gate/review.py`)

When automation runs, the workflow's own rule is split in two:

| Tier | Fires on | Who can override |
|---|---|---|
| **hard** | a failed fixture or harness, an attractor, a policy-file change, a `RATCHET-RAISE:` commit without the `ratchet-raise` label | nobody within the automation — evidence stays failed / policy stays held |
| **soft** | coverage gaps, confidence < 0.8, Sol's `needs-human`, an unparseable verdict | Fable, with a stated reason |

Hard-floor failures are strong signals for the human reviewer; they are still
not a separate required GitHub check beyond the [merge bar](#merge-bar-required).

## Automatic checks vs manual evidence

| Class | When it runs | Authority |
|---|---|---|
| **Automatic (no GPU CI, required)** | PR / push via [`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](../.github/workflows/ci.yml) | **Required** merge bar: `build (workspace, no GPU)`, `unit tests (lib, no GPU)`, `gates (ratchets, layering, registers)`. **Not** model coherence, serve semantics, or perf admission. |
| **Automatic (hw-gate, optional)** | PR via [`.github/workflows/hw-gate.yml`](../.github/workflows/hw-gate.yml) when that automation runs; hardware run after `hw-run` when buckets need it | **Optional** evidence delivery. Not a required status check; not automatic acceptance or promotion. |
| **Automatic (path-gated hooks)** | Local `pre-commit` on matching staged runtime paths | Runs the hotspot guards selected by the staged path set. Documentation-only staged sets do not trigger a separate docs hook. **Not** a full product matrix. |
| **Manual local no-GPU equivalent** | Human/agent invokes `scripts/no-gpu-ci.sh` outside CI | Same checks as the workflow script body; still **manual invocation**, not automatic CI. |
| **Manual (GPU / model)** | Human or agent on hardware with an explicit model path | Required for claim classes that name GPU/model routes (parity oracles, serve semantics, perf protocol, Redline promotion ladder, admissions) when those surfaces change — whether or not hw-gate ran. |
| **Direct maintainer review** | Human approval on the PR | **Required** (one approving review). Judges claim-matched evidence; automation comments are inputs, not substitutes. |

No-GPU CI green never substitutes for GPU/model evidence the claim map
requires. hw-gate green (when present) does not create an admission, skip
claim-specific oracles named below, or replace the approving review.

### Automatic entrypoints

| Route | Path | Role |
|---|---|---|
| No-GPU CI (required jobs) | [`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](../.github/workflows/ci.yml) (+ [`scripts/no-gpu-ci.sh`](../scripts/no-gpu-ci.sh) body) | **Required** automatic CI: workspace build, lib unit tests, ratchets/layering/registers gates. |
| **hw-gate (optional)** | [`.github/workflows/hw-gate.yml`](../.github/workflows/hw-gate.yml) + [`scripts/hw-gate/`](../scripts/hw-gate/) | **Optional** evidence automation: path → buckets, pinned fixtures, hardware run, seat commentary. See [§ hw-gate](#hw-gate-optional-evidence-automation). |
| Pre-commit hooks | [`.githooks/pre-commit`](../.githooks/pre-commit) | **Automatic** when hooks are installed (`scripts/install-hooks.sh`). Selects HOTSPOT / SERVE_HOTSPOT / PP_HOTSPOT runtime guards from staged paths; documentation-only staged sets exit without a separate docs gate. |
| Dispatch `bind_thread` invariant | [`scripts/verify-bind-thread.sh`](../scripts/verify-bind-thread.sh) (via pre-commit on matching paths) | **Automatic** when hooked: every public `dispatch.rs` entry must bind the HIP thread. Not a kernel numeric test. |
| Env/docs drift check | [`scripts/check-env-docs.py`](../scripts/check-env-docs.py) | **Automatic** through `scripts/no-gpu-ci.sh`; checks that referenced `HIPFIRE_*` names are documented and production reads are config-owned. |

### Manual local equivalents (not automatic)

| Route | Path | Role |
|---|---|---|
| No-GPU script | [`scripts/no-gpu-ci.sh`](../scripts/no-gpu-ci.sh) | Manual local run of the same body CI uses: `cargo check --workspace --examples`; selected no-GPU Rust and native control-plane tests; CPU pytest; env/docs coverage. |
| Env/docs drift check | [`scripts/check-env-docs.py`](../scripts/check-env-docs.py) | Fast standalone env-name coverage and ownership check. No GPU or model download. |

### Documentation checks

The shipped automated documentation-specific check is
[`scripts/check-env-docs.py`](../scripts/check-env-docs.py). It validates
environment-variable reference coverage and config ownership; it is not a
general Markdown link, lifecycle-label, or semantic-drift checker. Beta does
not currently ship a standalone `check-docs-reliability.py` command or a
documentation-only pre-commit gate. For documentation-only changes, run the
env/docs check plus `git diff --check`, and inspect changed links and commands
against the current tree.

### Maintained manual harness roles

Narrow roles. Do not widen a harness into a universal gate.

| Harness | Path | Role | Not this harness |
|---|---|---|---|
| **gates.sh** | [`scripts/gates.sh`](../scripts/gates.sh) | Maintained **manual** wrapper: optional Redline capture, generic serve battery, optional fresh-process perf compare (`probe_commits.sh`). Requires `--model`. | Not CI-default. Not universal. Does not call retired coherence-gate scripts. |
| **serve_harness.py** | [`scripts/serve_harness.py`](../scripts/serve_harness.py) | **Model-agnostic** user-facing serve behavior (battery / chain / session): finish reasons, runaway/empty, prefix cache, prefill/decode timing, recall hooks. | Not LFM thinking-frame specifics. Not Redline route proof. |
| **serve_harness.py (LFM tag)** | [`scripts/serve_harness.py`](../scripts/serve_harness.py) | LFM2.5 serve smoke with the exact registry tag; use registry sampling or `recipe:nothink` for non-thinking framing. | Not a substitute for numerical parity oracles. |
| **redline_daemon_harness.py** | [`scripts/redline_daemon_harness.py`](../scripts/redline_daemon_harness.py) | Resident-daemon **Redline** capture, phase fingerprint, shadow/parity, and timing evidence under manual-capture env. | Discovery/correctness evidence ≠ product timed-arm route proof by itself. Does not enable AQL routing. |
| **dispatch_profile** | [`tools/redline/dispatch_profile.py`](../tools/redline/dispatch_profile.py) | Manual **attribution-only** steady-state retained-PM4 per-dispatch span diagnostic (instrumented GFX12 tape). | **Not** route proof, certification/admission, or absolute/pure kernel timing: timestamp commands add observer overhead and spans include preceding PM4 boundary packets. |
| **tools.redline golden** | [`tools/redline/golden.py`](../tools/redline/golden.py) | Reproduce the exact checked-in MQ4R TG128 model/benchmark/route fixtures through the route-proof-capable product harness. | Not a universal GPU gate, a new-route certification shortcut, or an admission. |

### Supporting manual tools (existing; claim-scoped)

Use only when the claim class below names them. They are not universal.

| Tool | Path | Typical claim |
|---|---|---|
| Kernel channel tests | `target/release/examples/test_kernels` (build: `cargo build --release --features deltanet --example test_kernels -p hipfire-runtime`) | Kernel numeric vs CPU reference on the detected arch. **Not** dispatch bind coverage. |
| Dispatch bind check (manual) | [`scripts/verify-bind-thread.sh`](../scripts/verify-bind-thread.sh) | Same bind invariant as the hook; run explicitly if hooks are not installed. |
| Speed regression floor | [`scripts/speed-gate.sh`](../scripts/speed-gate.sh) | Prefill/decode vs committed `tests/speed-baselines/<arch>.txt` when that path’s policy applies. |
| Fresh-process commit probe | [`scripts/probe_commits.sh`](../scripts/probe_commits.sh) | Optional A/B invoked from `gates.sh --perf`. |
| Perf protocol | [`docs/methodology/perf-benchmarking.md`](methodology/perf-benchmarking.md) | How to measure; not an executable gate. |
| Redline certification ladder | [`docs/REDLINE.md`](REDLINE.md) | What evidence is required before Redline-attributed promotion. |
| Path-specific parity / state oracle | Arch-owned example or test named by the change (when one exists) | Hidden-state, logit, KV/conv, or graph parity. If none exists for the surface → **blocked**. |

## Claim → route map

| Claim / change class | Minimum route(s) | Evidence kind |
|---|---|---|
| Docs, env-var tables, no-GPU Rust/Python/CLI only | Automatic: `.github/workflows/no-gpu-ci.yml` invokes `scripts/no-gpu-ci.sh`; for a fast docs-only local check run `python3 scripts/check-env-docs.py` plus `git diff --check` | Automatic CI and/or manual local equivalent — **not** GPU/model evidence |
| New/changed `.hip` kernel (numeric) | `test_kernels`; then model-level manual route for the arch under test | Manual + channel |
| Dispatch `bind_thread` / public `dispatch.rs` bind surface | `.githooks/pre-commit` → `scripts/verify-bind-thread.sh` (or run that script manually) | Automatic hook or manual bind check — **not** `test_kernels` |
| Forward / fusion / KV **numerical or state parity** | Path-specific parity/state oracle for that arch/surface; **blocked** if no oracle exists | Manual oracle — **not** `serve_harness.py` |
| Forward / fusion / sampling / KV **user-facing serve semantics** | `scripts/serve_harness.py` with the exact model (after parity route if the change can break numbers/state); add `scripts/gates.sh` when the Redline+serve+optional perf wrapper is desired | Manual serve (semantics only) |
| LFM2.5 chat framing / thinking output | `scripts/serve_harness.py` with an `lfm2.5:*` registry tag | Manual LFM |
| VL vision-tower forward numerical parity (arch-5 / arch-11 carriers) | Dump-and-diff vs an HF `transformers` reference for the exact checkpoint, pixel inputs pinned by hash (`benchmarks/vision/dump_hf_reference.py` precedent; family route: [`qwen35-vl-mq4v2-spec.md`](qwen35-vl-mq4v2-spec.md) §5, [`specs/2026-08-27-qwen35-vl-vision-serve.md`](specs/2026-08-27-qwen35-vl-vision-serve.md)); **blocked** for a checkpoint with no reference dump. Expected floor on 4:2:0 JPEG inputs: `patches` rel-L1 ≈ 5e-3 (zune-jpeg IDCT/chroma vs PIL's libjpeg-turbo; `jpeg-decoder` only narrows it to ≈ 3.5e-3; since d147fccb3 hipfire decodes JPEG with `libjpeg-turbo-rs`, byte-identical to PIL/libjpeg-turbo on all five committed fixtures, and the `patches` floor is the CatmullRom-vs-PIL-bicubic kernel alone: ≈ 2.6e-3 on doge, max one u8 step; 2026-09-07); 4:4:4 inputs reach ≈ 1e-4. Judge tower parity on the shape of the per-block curve and the serve battery, not on beating that floor | Manual oracle — not `serve_harness.py`; a green VL serve battery is *not* parity evidence |
| VL image-bearing serve semantics (`generate_vl` over `/v1/chat/completions`) | Manual OpenAI-compatible battery through `hipfire serve` with the exact VL artifact: committed fixtures under [`../benchmarks/vision/images/`](../benchmarks/vision/images/) + the fixed desc/ocr prompts of `comparison-2026-05-23.md`, greedy temp 0; stream **and** non-stream typed-emission check (reasoning vs `content` deltas; no literal `<think>`/`<|im_end|>` chunks in content); client-disconnect probe mid-stream followed by an immediate follow-up turn (no slot wedge); eyeball every decoded output; record artifact sha256, fixture hashes, binary md5s. No scripted harness exists (**blocked** until one lands); `scripts/serve_harness.py` is text-only today and does not exercise this surface | Manual serve (semantics only) |
| Retained replay / PM4 / AQL graft | `scripts/redline_daemon_harness.py` **and** the certification steps in `docs/REDLINE.md` | Manual Redline; promotion still policy-gated |
| Perf improvement claim | Protocol in `methodology/perf-benchmarking.md` + stationary matched runs; `speed-gate.sh` or `gates.sh` perf arm when applicable | Measured; not admission |
| Existing sealed MQ4R Redline fixture reproduction | `python3 -m tools.redline golden` for its exact gfx1100/gfx1151/gfx1201 fixture only | Measured reproduction; exact identity + route proof + stationary floor; not admission. Does **not** imply that every default-eligible `.mq4r` model file is one of the sealed fixtures. |
| Arch port | `methodology/arch-port-validation.md` (channel + speed; no retired coherence battery as acceptance) | Manual |
| Model/route **admission** (registry evidence) | Row in [`admissions.yml`](admissions.yml) | Schema v2; exactly one evidence-bound record (LFM2.5-350M MQ4 gfx1201 retained-PM4). No inferred/wildcard rows. Registry admission/evidence is distinct from runtime wiring: the sealed LFM row does **not** select a runtime default and current automatic selection does not use it. |
| MQ4R **runtime** automatic Redline default | Source predicate `mq4r_redline_default` in `crates/hipfire-runtime/src/config.rs`; policy in [`REDLINE.md`](REDLINE.md) | **Only** current automatic runtime predicate. Runtime-only: exact GPU arch `gfx1100`, `gfx1151`, or `gfx1201`; PP=1; TP=1; case-insensitive `.mq4r` → retained PM4/Auto unless disabled with the config wizard's built-in `hip` profile, another explicit backend selection, or `HIPFIRE_REPLAY_BACKEND=hip`. Model-family agnostic (no `arch_id` gate). `gfx1200` and all other arches remain opt-in. Existing LFM `.mq4` registry evidence is not auto-selected because it is not `.mq4r`, not because LFM is categorically exempt; any usable non-default retained route must still prove route support and fail closed when unsupported. **Not** registry admission, **not** Section 7 certification, and **not** a sealed-fixture claim for every default-eligible `.mq4r` model. |
| Unknown surface | **Blocked** until an owner adds a row here | Fail closed |

## Retired gates (historical only)

The following are **retired as current acceptance evidence**. They must not
be required for merge, promotion, or benchmark claims.

| Pattern | Status |
|---|---|
| `scripts/coherence-gate-*.sh` (e.g. `coherence-gate-dflash.sh`, `coherence-gate-qwen35-dspark.sh`, `coherence-gate-minimax.sh`, `coherence-gate-cohere2moe.sh`, `coherence-gate-deepseek4-*.sh`, …) | **Historical reproduction only.** Never promotion or acceptance. |
| `tools/change_gate/`, `.github/agentic-review/`, and the pre-hw-gate agentic static-review route | **Retired.** Superseded as a review path; historical references only. Not merge evidence. |
| Other gate scripts **not named anywhere in this selector** | Do not treat as canonical acceptance unless a future INDEX/VALIDATION revision names them. Supporting tools already listed above stay in force. |

Campaign-specific guidance (for example an LFM effort that omits coherence
gates) is **not** a universal rule for every arch or model. Universality is
blocked on purpose.

## Explicit non-routes

| Anti-pattern | Disposition |
|---|---|
| One script that “replaces all gates” | **Rejected** — no universal gate. |
| Green no-GPU CI as proof of GPU correctness | **Rejected** |
| `serve_harness` as numerical/state parity or universal forward proof | **Rejected** — semantics only; oracle or **blocked** |
| `serve_harness` success as Redline route proof | **Rejected** |
| `redline_daemon_harness` fingerprint as installed product PM4/AQL route | **Rejected** without `REDLINE.md` ladder |
| Coherence-gate pass as current acceptance | **Rejected** |
| `change_gate` / agentic-review route as current acceptance | **Rejected** — retired; historical only |
| hw-gate success as required merge gate, auto-approval, or auto-promotion | **Rejected** — optional evidence only; direct review + required no-GPU checks remain |
| Missing/skipped hw-gate as a merge blocker by itself | **Rejected** — hw-gate is not a required status check |
| Bench number without protocol + identity hashes | **Rejected** as promotion evidence |
| Inferred or “signed” `admissions.yml` row without earned fixture evidence | **Rejected** — schema v2 forbids inferred/wildcard rows; only the exact admitted record applies |
