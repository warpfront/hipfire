# Architecture ID registry

Canonical `arch_id` values used by HFQ headers (`HfqFile::arch_id`), safetensors
directory derivation (`derive_arch_id` in
`crates/hipfire-runtime/src/safetensors_source.rs`), and the loader carrier
registry (`crates/hipfire-loader`). Trait markers come from
`Architecture::arch_id()` in each arch crate.

One crate may cover multiple runtime ids. The trait’s canonical marker is the
family default; the file/dir id on the loaded source is authoritative for
dispatch.

**Routing availability ≠ product admission.** A primary id, source derivation, or
carrier match means the loader can route that artifact — not that any model is
product-admitted. The sole admission owner is [`admissions.yml`](admissions.yml)
(schema v2; exactly one evidence-bound record). Product-use and admission claims
remain fail-closed for every route outside that exact row; source-derived routing capability is independent.

## Primary model ids

| arch_id | Family | Crate | Carrier | Notes |
|---:|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | LLaMA / Mistral | `hipfire-arch-llama` | `LlamaCarrier` | Dense FA. Trait marker `Llama::arch_id() == 0`. |
| 1 | plain Qwen3 | `hipfire-arch-llama` | `LlamaCarrier` | Same crate; `config_from_hfq` branches on metadata. Dir `model_type`/`architectures` qwen3 → 1. |
| 5 | Qwen3.5 / 3.6 / 3.8 dense | `hipfire-arch-qwen35` | `Qwen35Carrier` | Hybrid DeltaNet + dense FFN. Trait marker returns 5. Optional VL via `hipfire-arch-qwen35-vl` under the same ids. |
| 6 | Qwen3.5 / 3.6 / 3.8 MoE (A3B) | `hipfire-arch-qwen35` | `Qwen35Carrier` | MoE expert routing; same crate as 5. |
| 7 | Qwen2 dense | `hipfire-arch-qwen2` | `Qwen2Carrier` | Standalone path so Q/K/V `attention_bias` loads (llama dir path would drop them). Dir `qwen2` → 7. |
| 8 | dots.ocr (Qwen2-VL family) | `hipfire-arch-dots-ocr` | `DotsOcrCarrier` | Vision tower + Qwen2 text decoder fields on `LoadedModel`. |
| 9 | DeepSeek V4 Flash | `hipfire-arch-deepseek4` | `Deepseek4Carrier` | Hyper-Connections, compressed-KV indexer, tail-only RoPE, raw SWA; optional in-trunk / sidecar MTP; EP via `load_model_ep`. |
| 10 | MiniMax-M2 | `hipfire-arch-minimax` | `MinimaxCarrier` | Mixtral-style MoE (GQA, per-layer QK-norm, partial rotate_half RoPE, sigmoid+bias expert route). EP via `load_model_ep`. |
| 11 | LFM2.5 / LFM2.5-MoE | `hipfire-arch-lfm2moe` | `Lfm2MoeCarrier` | Hybrid short-conv + GQA; dense SwiGLU and/or top-4 MoE; tied embeddings. Dir `lfm2` / `lfm2_moe` / `lfm2_vl` → 11. Optional VL via `hipfire-arch-lfm2-vl` (SigLIP2-NaFlex tower + projector — spec `docs/specs/2026-08-27-lfm2-vl-vision-runtime.md`, carrier recipe `docs/lfm2-vl-mq4v2-spec.md`). |
| 12 | Cohere2-MoE (North-Mini-Code) | `hipfire-arch-cohere2moe` | `Cohere2MoeCarrier` | Parallel block, interleaved sliding(RoPE)/global(NoPE) GQA, sigmoid MoE, dense layer-0, tied embeddings. |
| 13 | Gemma 4 (dense text) | `hipfire-arch-gemma4` | `Gemma4Carrier` | Hybrid 5:1 sliding(RoPE θ=10k, hd 256)/full(partial RoPE θ=1e6, hd 512, K=V sharing) GQA, sandwich RMSNorm + `layer_scalar`, gelu_pytorch_tanh SwiGLU, tied lm_head, final logit softcap 30. Dir `gemma4` / `gemma4_text` → 13. Carrier also claims 22. |
| 14 | Muse Glimmer (dense text) | `hipfire-arch-muse-glimmer` | `MuseGlimmerCarrier` | 3:1 sliding(RoPE θ=500k, SWA 2048)/full(**NoPE**, `layer_rope_theta[i]==0`) GQA 32:2 hd 128, sandwich RMSNorm (`rms_norm_eps` 1e-5 pre / `post_norm_eps` 1e-8 post), scale-less QK-norm + `qk_scale_factor` 3.87, `self_attn.gate_proj` gated attention, silu SwiGLU, **untied** lm_head, `output_multiplier` 0.196116 then softcap 20. Dir `muse_glimmer` / `muse_glimmer_text` → 14. Carrier claims 14 only; the arch-23 drafter rides `HIPFIRE_DFLASH_DRAFT`. `pp>1` and `params.drafter` are refused. |
| 15 | Maple-Preview (natively-ternary MoE) | `hipfire-arch-maple` | `MapleCarrier` | 3:1 sliding(RoPE θ=10k, SWA 512)/full(**NoPE**, `nope_on_global_attention`) GQA 16:4 hd 128, **QK-norm applied BEFORE RoPE**, **partial rotary 0.5** (first 64 of 128 dims), MoE on EVERY layer (256 experts top-8, `moe_intermediate_size` 512, no shared experts, softmax→topk→renorm), **clamped SwiGLU** `silu(clamp(gate,max=7))*clamp(up,-7,7)`, **untied** lm_head, embedding tensor is `model.word_embeddings` (not `embed_tokens`). Weights are natively ternary and carried losslessly by qt=51 `MQ2G256LloydU`; `intermediate_size` 4096 and `quantize`/`preaffine` are dead keys. Dir `maple` → 15. |

Ids **2–4** are unused in the carrier registry (not claimed). Do not invent
assignments without a carrier + source mapping.

## Sidecar / reserved ids

These are **not** primary `load_model` trunk targets. Carriers must not claim
them for ordinary dispatch.

| arch_id | Role | Where defined | Notes |
|---:|---|---|---|
| 20 | DFlash draft artifact (generic) | `hipfire-quantize` `dflash_convert` (`ARCH_ID_DFLASH_DRAFT`); loader draft open checks `draft_hfq.arch_id == 20` | Generic Qwen-family diffusion draft (fc/hidden_norm/norm naming, `dflash` metadata). Loaded as a draft alongside a compatible target, not as a standalone serve model. |
| 21 | Qwen3.5 MTP head | `hipfire-quantize` `mtp_extract` (`ARCH_ID_QWEN35_MTP_HEAD`); consumed as `.mq4-mtp` trailer / `.mtp` sidecar on qwen35 trunks | Attached onto arch 5/6 loads (`LoadedModel.qwen35_mtp_head`), not a carrier `arch_id`. |
| 22 | Gemma4 EAGLE draft | `hipfire-arch-gemma4` `DRAFTER_ARCH_ID`; claimed by `Gemma4Carrier` alongside 13 | `model_type gemma4_unified_assistant` — hidden-state-consuming EAGLE (pre/post projections, KV-shared layers). Loaded via `params.drafter` on arch 13. **Currently gated off** (`HIPFIRE_GEMMA4_EAGLE=1` to enable): diverges from the greedy AR sequence it is required to reproduce, and is slower. |
| 23 | Muse Glimmer DFlash draft | `hipfire-arch-muse-glimmer` `GLIMMER_DRAFTER_ARCH_ID` | `model_type muse_glimmer_assistant` — 5-layer block-diffusion draft (encoder.fc/output_norm_enc, block 16, target_layer_ids [1,13,25,37,49], mask 201818). Loaded via `HIPFIRE_DFLASH_DRAFT` on arch 14. NOT a `dflash_convert` 20 artifact (different tensor naming: encoder.fc vs fc, separate `config` envelope). Quantizer auto-maps `muse_glimmer_assistant` → 23 (`hipfire-quantize/src/main.rs:8607`, `hipfire-runtime/src/safetensors_source.rs:271`); HFQ on disk is `arch 23`. |
| 0xFF | Toy / template | `hipfire-arch-toy` | Never ship; daemon must not dispatch. No current carrier claims it. Registry disjointness tests include `0xFF` and assert at most one claimer — they do **not** assert zero claimers / hard-reserved. |
| `u32::MAX` | Unclaimed dir sentinel | `safetensors_source::UNCLAIMED_ARCH_ID` | Emitted for unrecognized `model_type`; no carrier matches → fail closed. |

## Image-generation component ids (40–47)

Diffusion checkpoints are **components, not chat models**: loadable for image
generation, never text-served. The block is deliberately **high** — ids 16–19
stay free for the next sequential primary text arches, which a component
claim would silently collide with (the registry disjointness sweep covers
0..=64, so 40+ is still test-enforced).

The block is **grouped by family, extension-only**: FLUX.1 owns 40–43 (trunk +
its two text encoders + the VAE it shares with FLUX.2), FLUX.2 owns 45–46 (44
is intentionally spare, kept free for a future need), and future families
(SD/SDXL) start at 47. New components get the next free id;
ids are never re-numbered once a pack ships.

Only the trunk ids (40, 45) are claimed by a carrier. The sidecar ids (41, 42,
43, 46) live in the headers of the per-component HFQ packs that
`hipfire-quantize --flux-pipe` writes, and the trunk's carrier resolves the
sidecars next to the trunk file; no carrier claims a sidecar id on its own.

| arch_id | Family | Crate | Carrier | Notes |
|---:|---|---|---|---|
| 40 | Flux MMDiT (checkpoint trunk) | `hipfire-arch-diffusion` | `FluxDiffusionCarrier` | `model_type flux` or `_class_name FluxTransformer2DModel` → 40. Daemon name `flux_mmdit`, served as `img_generate`/`img_progress`/`img_done`, `/v1/images/generations` and `hipfire img`. Refused by text `generate`/`bench_prefill`. |
| 41 | T5-XXL / T5 (sidecar, FLUX.1) | `hipfire-arch-diffusion` | (sidecar) | Text-conditioning encoder for FLUX/SD3, DFlash-sidecar precedent (20/23). |
| 42 | CLIP-L (sidecar, FLUX.1) | `hipfire-arch-diffusion` | (sidecar) | 768-d pooled-text encoder feeding the MMDiT text stream alongside the T5 token sequence. Packed as its own HFQ component (distinct forward contract from T5 — do not reuse 41). |
| 43 | VAE (sidecar) | `hipfire-arch-diffusion` | (sidecar) | Latent encode (img2img) / decode (pixels); not a serve trunk. Shared across FLUX.1 and FLUX.2 (the FLUX.2 `ae`): one sidecar slot serves both trunks. |
| 44 | (reserved spare) | — | — | Kept free; nothing ships on it. |
| 45 | FLUX.2 MMDiT / Klein (checkpoint trunk) | `hipfire-arch-diffusion` | `FluxDiffusionCarrier` | `_class_name Flux2Transformer2DModel` or `model_type flux2` → 45. Qwen3 text encoder (taps 9/18/27), 32-ch FLUX.2 VAE with BatchNorm latent stats, empirical sigma shift, reference-image edit via `img_generate` `images[]`. Daemon name `flux2_mmdit`. |
| 46 | FLUX.2 Klein Qwen3 text encoder (sidecar) | `hipfire-arch-diffusion` | (sidecar) | Standard Qwen3 causal-LM conditioner (model_type `qwen3`, Qwen3-4B geometry); distinct from arch 1 chat `qwen3` — attached only via the FLUX.2 pack, never loaded standalone. |
| 47 | SD/SDXL UNet (checkpoint trunk) | (planned) | (none) | Reserved for `model_type sd` / `sdxl`; nothing ships on it yet. |

## Source namespaces

| Namespace | Origin | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| HFQ header | `HfqFile::arch_id` written at quantize/pack time | Primary table above; sidecars 20/21 |
| Safetensors dir | `derive_arch_id(&config)` | `llama`/`mistral`→0, `qwen3`→1, `qwen3.5`/`qwen3.6` (+experts→6 else 5), `qwen2`→7, `dots_ocr`→8, `deepseek_v4`→9, `minimax_m2`→10, `lfm2`/`lfm2_moe`/`lfm2_vl`→11 (runtime `arch_mapping.rs` MODEL_TYPE_TO_ARCH_ID also carries `lfm2_vl`), `cohere2_moe`→12 |

`Carrier::claims_arch_id(arch_id, is_dir)` may distinguish the two namespaces.
Today’s carriers are disjoint on bare id for the ids they claim; registry unit
tests sweep `0..=64` plus reserved 20 and `0xFF` for both `is_dir` values and
require at most one claimer (disjointness only — not a zero-claimer guarantee
for `0xFF`).

## Dispatch sites (maintainers)

| Concern | Location |
|---|---|
| Load (single arch-dispatch) | `hipfire_loader::load_model` → `REGISTRY` probe |
| EP load | `hipfire_loader::load_model_ep` (9, 10) |
| Spec target / emitter by id | `hipfire_loader::carrier_for` |
| Generate short-circuits | `crates/hipfire-daemon/src/main.rs` `generate` (EP first; then 7, 9, 11, 12, 10, 8; else qwen35/llama body) |
| Trait contract | `crates/hipfire-runtime/src/arch.rs` |

Vision-capable loads: Qwen3.5-VL rides ids **5/6** with optional vision
weights; dots.ocr is id **8**. New vision arches need explicit generate and
HTTP image gating in the daemon, not only a carrier.
