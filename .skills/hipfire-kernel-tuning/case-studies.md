# Case studies — wins, losses, and the methodology in action

Five worked examples from the actual hipfire git log. Each shows
the workflow from `playbook.md` running on real engineering — a
mix of decisive wins, fake wins caught by discipline, and silent
corruption caught by gating. The lessons are the durable artifact;
the numbers will move as the engine evolves.

## §1 — wave64 CDNA3 port (decisive 2× win)

**Commit**: `4105035` — "perf(cdna3): full wave64 port of all hot
HFQ4 kernels — MI300X decode 48.6 → 96 tok/s"

**Bottleneck**: MI300X (gfx94x) is wave64 native, but hipfire's
HFQ4 kernels were wave32. On a wave64 wave running a wave32 kernel,
half the lanes silently mask out — the kernel produces correct
output but at 50% effective throughput.

**Lever**: per-arch wave64 variant. Ten kernels ported with
2-rows-per-block wave64 lane decomposition.

**Numbers**:

```
A3B decode pre-port:  48.6 tok/s on MI300X (gfx942)
A3B decode post-port: 96.0 tok/s — matches 7900 XTX on the same model
```

**Validation path**:
- Channel-test against CPU reference on synthetic HFQ4 weights
  (caught a wave-lane-mapping bug pre-merge).
- Coherence-gate ran against the standard model matrix.
- Speed-gate on the MI300X showed no regression on RDNA archs
  (the wave64 path is gated by `arch.starts_with("gfx94")`).

**Lesson**: wave-size mismatch is a 2× perf cliff, not a small
inefficiency. Worth a proper port any time the target arch's wave
size differs from your kernel's. The pattern (separate `.wave64.hip`
or `.gfx942.hip` file) keeps RDNA dispatch unaffected.

## §2 — nontemporal weight-load fake win (caught by clean-baseline bisect)

**Commits**: `0532579` (the candidate) → `34eb024` (the revert).

**Setup**: an experiment to use `__builtin_nontemporal_load` for
weight reads on hot decode kernels, intuition being that decode
weights are streaming-read (each token re-reads them once) and
shouldn't pollute L2.

**Initial measurement** (within-session A/B): +2.0% decode tok/s on
9B MQ4. Looked plausible, committed.

**Bisect against committed speed-gate baseline** (April 12 anchor):
**−13% decode**. 131 → 113 tok/s on 7900 XTX 9B MQ4.

The within-session A/B happened in a GPU state already skewed by
many preceding bench runs — preceding warmup put L2 in a state
where the nontemporal change *appeared* to win, but a fresh process
with a cold cache showed the actual regression.

**Hypothesis** (in the revert commit message): on RDNA3, the
nontemporal load path bypasses cache-line allocation but ALSO
defeats wave-level coalescing/prefetch behavior the default load
path gets for free. Each wave was issuing one coalesced 128-byte
transaction for 32 packed-u32 weight reads; the nontemporal hint
broke that coalescing pattern.

**Lessons**:
1. **Always bisect against the committed baseline**, not your last
   bench run. The speed-gate baseline file
   (`tests/speed-baselines/<arch>.txt`) exists for exactly this reason.
2. **Hypothesis without measurement = noise**. The nontemporal
   intuition was reasonable on paper. The hardware behavior was
   different.
3. **Reverts are first-class commits**. The revert commit message
   captures the WHY so the next contributor doesn't try the same
   thing for the same reasons.

## §3 — k2x32 wider-row variant (null result, kept for posterity)

**Commit**: `f670e16` — "experiment(gemm): k2x32 wider-row lm_head —
null result"

**Hypothesis**: on the M=248320 lm_head kernel, a 32-row block
(versus the 16-row default) would halve block count and amortize
X-fragment loads across 2 WMMA issues per K-tile.

**Result**: 46% **slower** at the target shape. 1564 µs (k2 baseline)
→ 2280 µs (k2x32). Effective BW dropped from 446 GB/s to 307 GB/s.

**Root cause**: doubled accumulator (`float8_t × 2`) plus 4× dequant
live ranges pushed wave register pressure past the compiler's
budget, forcing spills or reducing effective occupancy. 310 GB/s
(32% of 960 peak) signals latency-bound, not BW-bound — more
parallel WMMAs don't help when you can't pipeline them.

**Why kept**: the kernel + `HIPFIRE_WO_WMMA_VARIANT=k2x32` env
override stayed in the tree even though auto-dispatch routes around
it. A future revisit with LDS-staged B-share + manual register
budgeting might unlock it. The negative result is a known-checkpoint
that future tuning passes don't have to re-discover.

**Lesson**: register pressure is the gating constraint past a
certain point. More parallel work does not help when the compiler
can't pipeline the issue chain. When you measure a kernel at
~30% peak BW and the obvious "do more" lever loses, the bottleneck
is latency, not BW — different lever class.

## §4 — gfx11 WMMA C-mapping silent corruption (caught only by channel-test)

**Commit**: `b7ac66a` — "wmma correctness fix + MQ6 family +
cross-arch prefill + gate framework"

**Setup**: gfx11 (RDNA3) WMMA was the WMMA workhorse for hipfire
since the v0.1.4 line. The C-output mapping
(`acc[j] = C[2*j + (tid>>4)][tid & 15]`) was silently wrong for
**~6 weeks**.

**How it stayed hidden**:
- All speed-gates passed — the kernel produced numbers, just wrong
  ones in the same ballpark.
- Coherence-gates passed — output was English-shaped, on-topic-ish,
  no panics or zero-tokens or attractor loops.
- Functional tests passed — comparing kernel output to itself
  doesn't catch a systematic mapping error.
- Real-model tok/s didn't regress noticeably — quality degradation
  was within "MQ4 is lossy by nature" range.

**How it got caught**: a channel-test that compared kernel output
**element by element against a CPU reference on synthetic
deterministic inputs** flagged a row-mod-16 pattern of mismatches.
The histogram diagnostic that landed in PR #56's gfx12 channel
tests is the tool that would have caught this in 30 seconds.

**Lessons**:
1. **Channel-test is the load-bearing correctness gate**, not
   speed-gate or coherence-gate. The other two are weaker signals
   that miss systematic errors.
2. **Per-lane mappings are silent-corruption magnets.** WMMA, MFMA,
   and any cooperative-thread reduction has implicit mapping
   conventions that you can get wrong without any obvious symptom.
3. **The row-mod-16 histogram diagnostic is reusable** — every
   future WMMA / MFMA channel-test should include it (it would
   have caught this in seconds).

The arch-port skill (`.skills/hipfire-arch-port/`) explicitly cites
this commit as the cautionary tale for new contributors. PR #56
followed that guidance and avoided the trap entirely on gfx12.

## §5 — 27B DFlash perf recovery (root-causing a real regression)

**Commit**: `9a2c667` — "perf-recovery: restore 27B DFlash perf +
flip prompt_normalize default ON + DFlash speed-gate"

**Setup**: 27B DFlash decode regressed 30-40% suddenly. Looked
catastrophic.

**Investigation path** (over 6 hours of bisecting):

1. Suspect rocBLAS — null. `HIPFIRE_ROCBLAS_OFF=1` made no difference.
2. Suspect DKMS / firmware — null. `dmesg` clean, kernel firmware
   versions matched.
3. Suspect mold / sccache — null. Clean rebuild reproduces.
4. Suspect DPM / thermal — null. `pp_dpm_sclk` looked normal.
5. **Found it**: prompt structure. A whitespace-cleanup edit to a
   bench script changed `\n\n\n` → `\n\n`. Same prompt by token
   count, totally different by token sequence. τ collapsed from
   9.42 to 8.07; tok/s from 199 to 161.

**Lessons** (now codified in CLAUDE.md and AGENTS.md):
1. **Prompt structure dictates τ.** One newline character can swing
   τ by 17%. Embed prompts as committed files, record prompt md5
   alongside results.
2. **Tight stddev on a spec-decode bench is suspicious, not
   reassuring.** The "before" measurement had tight stddev
   suggesting a deterministic attractor; real acceptance is wider.
3. **Bisect attribution is hard when the cause is in the test
   harness, not the engine.** Always reproduce the regression on
   a different prompt before deep-diving the engine.

The fix: implement engine-side `\n{3,}` → `\n\n` collapse default-on
(`prompt_normalize` config key, commit `9a2c667`). +24% τ on PEP-8-
style code prompts vs the opt-out path.

## §6 — wave64 residual gemv on MI300X (small win, BW-saturation ceiling)

**Commit**: this branch — "perf(cdna3): wave64 port of gemv_hfq4g256_residual"

**Bottleneck**: rocprof on 27B 3.6 mq4 decode (50 gen tokens, asym3 KV)
showed `gemv_hfq4g256_residual.kd` at 19.2% of GPU time — the largest
non-wave64 kernel after the 2026-04-17 (`4105035`) wave64 port. The
original commit ported 10 hot HFQ4 kernels but missed the residual
variants of gemv (`_residual` and `_wide`).

**Hypothesis**: wave64 port should give 1.5-2× per-call speedup
(matching the original commit's win on the same kernel family).

**Lever**: §1 wave-size port. New `gemv_hfq4g256_residual_wave64.hip`
with 2-rows-per-block layout (warp_id selects row, lane drives the
32-lane reduction unchanged). Dispatch routes via `has_wave64_native(arch)`.

**Numbers**:

```
27B 3.6 decode pre-port:  66.0 tok/s on MI300X (gfx942)
27B 3.6 decode post-port: 68.1 tok/s     (+3.2%, within noise)

per-call kernel time:
  pre-port:   28783 ns/call (single-row wave32 on wave64 hardware)
  post-port:  25222 ns/call (two-rows-per-block wave64)              -12.4%

A3B 3.6 decode pre/post: 194.6 → 198.0 tok/s (+1.7%, within noise)
```

**Why the small wall-clock delta despite -12% kernel time**: residual
gemv on this shape (M ~ 5120, K ~ 5120, single output row per warp32) is
**bandwidth-bound, not lane-bound**. Each row already saturates a wide
HBM3 read on MI300X regardless of wave size — the wave32 kernel was
issuing one coalesced 128-byte transaction every 32 packed-u32 weight
reads, and the new wave64 kernel pays the same BW for half the lanes.
The 12% per-call drop is real (less ALU pressure on the unused upper
lanes) but the wall-clock is dominated by the BW transfer, not the
compute pipeline.

**Lesson**: wave64 port wins biggest on kernels that are
**lane-utilization-bound** (multi-row fused projections like qkv, where
each lane has its own row-output to compute). On per-row gemv shapes
that are already BW-saturated, the win is incremental — ship it because
it's correctness-preserving and additive with future fusion work, but
don't expect 2× decode.

**Cross-arch**: gated by `has_wave64_native(&self.arch)`, so
gfx908/gfx940/gfx941/gfx942 only. RDNA archs unchanged. Speed-gate on
gfx1100 should pass byte-exact.

---

## §7 — LDS-staged X share on gate_up (null result, kept opt-in for posterity)

**Commit**: `feb16a1` — "experiment(gate_up): LDS-staged X share
variant — pp512 prefill -12% (null result)"

**Variant kernel**: `kernels/src/gemm_gate_up_hfq4g256_wmma_ldsx.hip`,
opt-in via `HIPFIRE_GATE_UP_VARIANT=ldsx`. Investigation tracked in
issue #60 (which has the v2 plan + three independent adversarial
reviews recorded in the comment thread).

**Bottleneck identified**: per-wave VMEM latency in front of WMMA B in
the baseline `gemm_gate_up_hfq4g256_wmma` inner loop. ISA dump shows
`s_waitcnt vmcnt(0)` immediately before the second WMMA each
K-tile-pair iteration — the compiler couldn't schedule enough
independent work to hide the b_b load latency.

**Lever attempted**: LDS-staged X share — the "unfinished follow-up"
from §3's k2x32 lessons. Cooperative global → LDS load once per
K-tile-pair, then ds_read into the WMMA B operand. Theory: replace
the ~50 cycle `vmcnt(0)` VMEM stall with a ~20 cycle `lgkmcnt`
LDS-read stall, hidden by the dequant work that already sits between
the X load and WMMA.

**Design**: per-K-tile-pair LDS slab (1 KB stages, 2 KB
double-buffered) — chosen specifically to *avoid* the occupancy
collapse the v1 design sketch would have hit at 16 KB per block.
Cooperative load mapping splits the 16 batches × 32 K-element tile
across all 32 lanes (each loads its own unique 16 fp16) to fix the
wave-redundancy where lanes 0-15 and lanes 16-31 currently re-read
the same X columns.

**Numbers** (Qwen 3.5 9B MQ4, gfx1100, ROCm 7.2,
`HIPFIRE_PROFILE=1 ... --warmup 5 --gen 0`):

| | baseline gate_up µs/call | LDSX gate_up µs/call | Δ per-call |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| pp32 | 261 | 314 | **+20.3%** |
| pp128 | 895 | 1157 | **+29.3%** |
| pp512 | 1760 | 2415 | **+37.2%** |

| | baseline prefill tok/s | LDSX prefill tok/s | Δ |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| pp32 | 598 | 492 | −17.7% |
| pp128 | 792 | 760 | −4.0% |
| pp512 | 1155 | 1012 | −12.4% |

Effective BW collapses 178 → 64 → 41 GiB/s on gate_up as batch grows.
The kernel is *more* memory-bound at large M than the baseline, not
less.

**Validation path**:

- **Gate 0 (ISA inspection) — PASSED.** `hipcc -save-temps -S -O3
  --offload-arch=gfx1100` showed: 75 VGPRs (down from baseline 80),
  no `s_barrier` emitted (single-wave-per-block elides
  `__syncthreads()`), weight load preserved at the top of the
  inner loop, ds_read followed by ~145 instructions of dequant
  before WMMA. All four Gate 0 criteria from the v2 plan
  satisfied.
- **Gate 1 (microbench) — FAILED.** Per-call wall time regressed
  at every pp size. Issue #60 thread documents the full per-pp
  breakdown plus the comparison vs the baseline ISA.

**Why ISA-clean still regressed**: the baseline inner loop has
2 VMEM stalls per K-tile-pair (`vmcnt(2)` before WMMA A,
`vmcnt(0)` before WMMA B). The LDSX inner loop has 3 VMEM stalls
+ 2 LGKM stalls per iteration (vmcnt waits in the LDS-store phase,
vmcnt before dequant for the weight load, and lgkmcnt waits before
each WMMA). More stall events, smaller individual latencies.
Critically, the baseline's `vmcnt(0)` was already partially hidden
by wave-level ILP (2 waves/SIMD baseline → wave scheduler swaps to
sibling wave during the stall), so eliminating it didn't free as
much wall time as the static analysis suggested. Meanwhile the
new LDS round-trip costs were paid in full.

**Why kept**: the kernel + dispatch arm stay in the tree
(default-off opt-in via `HIPFIRE_GATE_UP_VARIANT=ldsx`) so future
revisits — possibly on RDNA4 (gfx12 gains `s_prefetch_data`) or
with a fundamentally different LDS layout (e.g., LDS holds
*dequantized* weights instead of X, making the lever go after the
A-side load not the B-side) — don't have to rebuild the
infrastructure from scratch. Mirrors the §3 k2x32 disposition.

**Three reviews caught the headline issues, two of them caught
issues that turned out to be moot, one caught the issue that
mattered most**:

- All three (Claude, Gemini, GLM-5): "32× X-load reduction" framing
  was wrong on multiple axes. Confirmed empirically.
- Gemini §1 + GLM §2: occupancy collapse risk if LDS budget grows
  to 16 KB/block. **Moot** — v2 design used 2 KB and Gate 0 ISA
  showed VGPRs went *down* not up.
- GLM §4: `__syncthreads()` would force a pipeline flush and
  destroy compiler scheduling freedom. **Moot** — single-wave
  blocks elide the barrier entirely.
- GLM §2: ~50% of `vmcnt(0)` stalls are already hidden by
  wave-level ILP. **This was the load-bearing critique.**
  Eliminating already-hidden stalls is the textbook recipe for a
  null result, and that's exactly what we got — except worse,
  because we replaced them with new stalls the wave scheduler
  couldn't hide as well.

**Lesson**: ISA inspection alone is insufficient. A clean ISA
(no barrier emitted, weight prefetch preserved, VGPR budget healthy)
predicted a net win that didn't materialize on the bench. The
missing piece was wave-scheduler-level latency hiding, which is
invisible in static analysis but dominant in wall-time measurement.
**Always pair ISA inspection with cycle-counting microbench before
committing to a kernel rewrite.** And if a stall you're trying to
remove is in a kernel that's already running at meaningful
SIMD-utilization (≥20%), assume the wave scheduler is hiding
*some* of it — your ceiling is smaller than the per-iteration
cycle count suggests.

**For future revisit**: don't re-try this exact design. If you want
to attack the same `vmcnt(0)` stall with a different mechanism,
the candidates are:

- Pre-dequantize the A-side into LDS (move the lever to weights, not
  X — A is read-once-per-row, X is read-once-per-batch, but A's
  dequant work is what's currently filling the stall window —
  removing it changes the schedule).
- gfx12 `s_prefetch_data` (per `levers.md §5`) — different
  hardware, different tradeoffs.
- Restructure the inner loop to issue more independent WMMAs in
  parallel, giving the scheduler more work to hide individual
  stalls behind. This loops back to the K4 / K8 deeper-pipelining
  discussion that's currently blocked on K4's correctness bug.

## §8 — K4 output-mapping bug fix (correctness restored, no perf change)

**Commit**: `2135513` — "fix(gemm): K4 output mapping — was swapped
relative to canonical wave32 WMMA C-mapping"

**Companion commits**:

- `e00ece7` — prerequisite channel-test patch (row-varying weights
  + K∈{256,512,4096} sweep). The bug was invisible to the original
  test at batch=1.
- Investigation tracked in issue #60 (which has the v2 plan + three
  independent adversarial reviews recorded in the comment thread).

**Bottleneck identified**: `gemm_hfq4g256_residual_wmma_k4.hip` was
labeled "output-mapping bug, τ=0 on dflash, debug only" in
`dispatch.rs` and gated behind `HIPFIRE_WO_WMMA_VARIANT=k4`, never
auto-dispatched. The K4 author had written the output block against
an incorrect mental model of the RDNA3 wave32 WMMA accumulator
layout — same class as commit `b7ac66a` (case-studies §4).

**Lever**: §3 K-tile depth (specifically the K4 step). The K2 step
of the same lever has been deployed across all dominant prefill
GEMMs since long before this work. The K4 step was broken; this
commit fixes it.

**The author's mental model vs. the hardware**:

- Hardware: `acc[j] = C[2*j + (tid >> 4)][tid & 15]`. Each lane
  holds 8 rows of one batch column.
- K4 author wrote: `acc[j] = C[tid & 15][(tid >> 4) * 8 + j]`.
  Each lane holds 8 batches of one row.

These mappings are transposed. Output corruption grew with batch
size because at batch=1 the mismatch happened to coincide on a
single column.

**Numbers (Qwen 3.5 9B MQ4, gfx1100, ROCm 7.2)**:

Channel-test before fix (broken K4):

| K | batch | bad cells |
|---|---|---|
| 256 | 1 | 15/16 |
| 256 | 2 | 30/32 |
| 4096 | 16 | 224/256 |

Channel-test after fix (K4 with K2-mirror output mapping):

| K | batch | bad cells |
|---|---|---|
| 256 | 1 | 0/16 |
| 256 | 2 | 0/32 |
| 4096 | 16 | 0/256 |

K4-fixed matches K2 byte-for-byte across the full matrix.

Bench Phase 3a (residual at m=4096, 9B):

| | ksplit µs/call | K2 µs/call | K4-fixed µs/call |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| pp32 | 95 | 126 | 126 |
| pp128 | 315 | 327 | 331 |
| pp512 | 626 | 651 | 628 |

K4 ties K2 within FP drift but doesn't beat ksplit at m<8192
because ksplit's K-split + atomicAdd is the right structural lever
for CU-starved small-m grids (~13 blocks/CU vs K4's 3.3 blocks/CU
under `__launch_bounds__(32, 1)`). Auto-dispatch logic unchanged.

K4 vs K2 at m≥8192 not benched — no model with residual m≥8192
available locally. Future work.

**Validation path**:

- **Channel-test patched first** (e00ece7) — the original test
  used row-invariant weights (`w[r][k] = 1.0` along the diagonal),
  making `C[r][b]` independent of r. That hid row-shuffle errors
  at batch=1 entirely. Patched test uses `w[r][k] = (r+1)*0.05`
  along the diagonal, exposing the dimensional mismatch
  immediately.
- **K4 source patched** to mirror K2's canonical output mapping.
- **Cache layers force-invalidated** before re-test (see Lesson).
- **Channel-test green** at K∈{256,512,4096} × batch∈{1,2,4,16}.
- **Bench Phase 3a** confirmed no regression vs K2 at m<8192.

**Lesson 1 (the methodology bug, equal weight to the kernel
fix)**: A previous attempt to apply this exact same fix during
the LDSX investigation session reported "bit-identical wrong
output between original K4 and K2-mirror K4" — and was used to
conclude that the bug was NOT in the output mapping. That
conclusion was wrong. Reconstructed evidence:

- Post-fix test run did NOT print
  `pre-compiled blob has no hash file, recompiling`.
- Post-revert test run DID print it.
- Same test, same input, asymmetric cache behavior across two
  back-to-back runs.

Almost certainly the post-fix run served the cached unmodified
K4 binary because:

- `write-kernel-hashes.sh` updates source-hash sidecars without
  recompiling the precompiled blob.
- The runtime checks the sidecar but does not verify against the
  blob.
- Three cache layers exist (`kernels/compiled/gfx1100/`,
  `.hipfire_kernels/gfx1100/`, `.hipfire_kernels/`); at least
  one served stale data.

**For any kernel-source change, the cache invalidation procedure
is**:

```bash
rm -f kernels/compiled/<arch>/<kernel>.hsaco
rm -f kernels/compiled/<arch>/<kernel>.hash
rm -rf $HOME/.hipfire_kernels/<arch>/<kernel>.*
rm -f .hipfire_kernels/<kernel>.*
rm -f .hipfire_kernels/<arch>/<kernel>.*
./scripts/write-kernel-hashes.sh
rm -f target/release/examples/<bin>
cargo build --release ...
```

Verify the `recompiling` message appears at first invocation.
**If it doesn't, the test is running stale code.** Don't trust
any null result that didn't print this message.

**Lesson 2 (the test-design bug)**: A channel-test that uses
row-invariant data has a silent false-negative for the
row-shuffle bug class — exactly the class that the WMMA C-mapping
errors fall into (case-studies §4 / §8). Always use data that
varies independently along every dimension the kernel could
shuffle. Pattern:

```rust
// row-varying:    weight[r][diag_position] = (r+1) * 0.05
// batch-varying:  x[b][k] = (b+1) * 0.1
// → C[r][b] varies with both. Row-shuffle / batch-shuffle visible.
```

Original test used `weight = 1.0` (row-invariant), missed it.

**Lesson 3 (multi-reviewer value)**: This bug went undetected
through the LDSX session because the single-reviewer process
caught the wrong thing — I diagnosed a hypothetical WMMA
issue-rate constraint (case-studies §7-class hypothesis) and
missed both the cache flaw and the test blind spot. Three
independent reviews (Claude v1, Gemini, GLM-5) of the K4 plan
*all* identified the misdiagnosis from different angles:

- Gemini: "The Output Stage Fallacy" — output mapping is broken
  by direct source inspection.
- GLM-5: "The session's K4 fix experiment was likely invalidated
  by stale precompiled-blob caching" + "channel-test has a
  row-invariance blind spot at batch=1."
- Claude v2 (post-peer-review): synthesized both into the v2 plan
  that proceeded H0-first.

The single-reviewer pass (Claude v1) was confidently wrong in a
way that would have wasted ~2-3 days of bisect-the-wrong-thing
investigation. The 3-reviewer pass converged on the right
diagnosis in one round. **For high-stakes investigation plans,
run multiple independent reviews before executing.**

**Why kept the variant opt-in**: the K4 dispatch arm stays in the
tree. K4 vs K2 at m≥8192 has not been benched on the available
hardware/models — future work on a 70B-class model could test
whether K4's deeper unroll wins where ksplit's atomicAdd overhead
no longer pays off. The fix means K4 is *available* for that
future test, not that it currently beats anything.

## How to add a case study

If you land a real perf win or revert worth documenting, append a
new §N section here. Required fields:

- **Commit** — the canonical commit hash.
- **Bottleneck** — what the profile said.
- **Lever** — which entry from `levers.md` you used.
- **Numbers** — before / after with binary md5 + prompt md5.
- **Validation path** — which gates ran, what they showed.
- **Lesson** — the durable insight a future contributor needs.

Negative results (null lift, fake win caught) are equally
valuable — they save the next person from re-running the same
experiment. Don't omit them just because they "didn't ship."
